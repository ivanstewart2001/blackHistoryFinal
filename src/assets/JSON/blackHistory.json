        "summary": "Born into humble circumstances in Mobile, Alabama, Hank Aaron ascended the ranks of the Negro Leagues to become a Major League Baseball icon. He spent most of his 23 seasons as an outfielder for the Milwaukee and Atlanta Braves, during which time he set many records, including a career total of 755 home runs. Aaron was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1982, and in 1999, MLB established the Hank Aaron Award to annually honor the top hitter in each league. As Aaron drew closer to home run No. 714, the chase to beat the Babe's record revealed that world of baseball was far from being free of the racial tensions that prevailed around it. Letters poured into the Braves offices, as many as 3,000 a day for Aaron. Some wrote to congratulate him, but many others were appalled that a Black man should break baseball's most sacred record. Death threats were a part of the mix.Still, Aaron pushed forward. He didn't try to inflame the atmosphere, but he didn't keep his mouth shut, either, speaking out against the league's lack of ownership and management opportunities for minorities. On the field, Blacks have been able to be super giants,' he once stated. 'But, once our playing days are over, this is the end of it and we go back to the back of the bus again. After retiring as a player, Aaron moved into the Atlanta Braves front office as executive vice president, where he became a leading spokesman for minority hiring in baseball. He was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1982, and eight years later, he published his autobiography, I Had a Hammer. In 2002, he was honored with the Presidential Medal of Freedom. Slowed by hip replacement surgery in 2014, Aaron nevertheless made it to a ceremony in January 2016 in which he was awarded the Japanese Order of the Rising Sun, Gold Rays with Rosette. He was honored for his close relationship to Japanese baseball legend Sadaharu Oh, and for his efforts to promote the two countries' shared love of the game.",

        "summary": "Ira Frederick Aldridge was the first African American actor to achieve success on the international stage. He also pushed social boundaries by playing opposite white actresses in England and becoming known as the preeminent Shakespearean actor and tragedian of the 19th Century. Ira Frederick Aldridge was born in New York City, New York on July 24, 1807 to free blacks Reverend Daniel and Lurona Aldridge.  Although his parents encouraged him to become a pastor, he studied classical education at the African Free School in New York where he was first exposed to the performance arts.  While there he became impressed with acting and by age 15 was associating with professional black actors in the city. They encouraged Aldridge to join the prestigious African Grove Theatre, an all-black theatre troupe founded by William Henry Brown and James Hewlett in 1821. He apprenticed under Hewlett, the first African American Shakespearean actor. Though Aldridge was gainfully employed as an actor in the 1820s, he felt that the United States was not a hospitable place for theatrical performers.  Many whites resented the claim to cultural equality that they saw in black performances of Shakespeare and other white-authored texts. Realizing this, Aldridge emigrated to Europe in 1824 as the valet for British-American actor James William Wallack. Aldridge eventually moved to Glasgow, Scotland and began studies at the University of Glasgow, where he enhanced his voice and dramatic skills in theatre. He moved to England and made his debut in London in 1825 as Othello at the Theatre Royal Covent Garden, a role he would remain associated with until his death. The critic reviews gave Aldridge the name Roscius (the celebrated Roman actor of tragedy and comedy). Aldridge embraced it and began using the stage name “The African Roscius.” He even created the myth that he was the descendant of a Senegalese Prince whose family was forced to escape to the United States to save their lives. This deception erased Aldridge’s American upbringing and cast him as an exotic and almost magical being. Throughout the mid-1820s to 1860 Ira Aldridge slowly forged a remarkable career. He performed in London, Liverpool, Edinburgh, Bath, and Bristol in King Lear, Othello, Macbeth, and The Merchant of Venice. He also freely adapted classical plays, changing characters, eliminating scenes and installing new ones, even from other plays. In 1852 he embarked on a series of continental tours that intermittently would last until the end of his life. He performed his full repertoire in Prussia, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Hungary, and Poland. Some of the honors he received include the Prussian Gold Medal for Arts and Sciences from King Frederick, the Golden Cross of Leopold from the Czar of Russia, and the Maltese Cross from Berne, Switzerland. Aldridge died on August 7, 1867 while on tour in Lodz, Poland. He was 60 at the time of his death.  Aldridge had been married twice and left behind several children including a daughter named Luranah who would, in her own right, go on to become a well-known actress and opera singer. There is a memorial plaque at the Royal Shakespeare Theatre in Stafford-upon-Avon, in honor of his contributions to the performing arts.  In 2014 a second plaque was unveiled in Lodz, Poland to honor his memory and legacy.",

        "occupation": "Athlete",
        "summary": "Muhammad Ali, arguably the most famous professional boxer in the 20th Century and the only fighter to win the heavyweight championship three times, was born Cassius Clay in 1942 in Louisville, Kentucky, to Cassius Marcellus Clay, Sr. and Odessa Grady Clay. At the age of 12 Clay began training as a boxer. During his teen years he won several Golden Gloves titles and other amateur titles. At the age of 18 he won a gold medal in the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome, Italy and then turned professional. In one of the most famous boxing matches of the century, Clay in 1965 stunned the world by beating apparently invincible world heavyweight champion Sonny Liston in six rounds. After defeating Liston, Clay announced his conversion to Islam and joining of the Nation of Islam (NOI) under the leadership of Elijah Muhammad. Clay also announced he changed his name to Muhammad Ali. As a member of the NOI, Ali was mentored early on by the organization’s most charismatic leader, Malcolm X. In 1967, at the height of the Vietnam War, Ali received his induction notice. Instead of dodging the draft, Ali announced publicly that he refused induction. Government officials shortly thereafter tried, convicted, and sentenced the boxing champion to five years in prison for draft evasion, but he remained free pending appeals. However, United States boxing officials stripped him of his boxing title and suspended his license. During his suspension, Ali became an activist, touring the country, speaking to civil rights organizations and antiwar groups. In 1970, boxing officials reinstated Ali’s boxing privileges. That same year he won a heavyweight title in a match in New York City, New York. In 1971 he lost a title fight to Joe Frazier in New York City but later that year the United States Supreme Court reversed his conviction for draft evasion. In an epic rematch in New York City on January 28, 1974, Ali defeated Frazier who by this time had lost the title to George Foreman. Later that year Ali defeated Foreman when the two met in Kinshasa, Zaire in a fight popularly known as “The Rumble in the Jungle,” to regain the title. Ali and Frazier met a third time in Quezon City, Philippines on October 1, 1975 in a bout that many consider the “Fight of the Century.” Known as “The Thrilla in Manila,” the two boxers met in 100 degree temperatures. Ali won when a technical knockout (TKO) when Frazier’s trainer refused to allow his fighter to answer the bell for the 15th Round. After the fight Ali declared Frazier “the greatest fighter of all times next to me.” In early 1978 Ali lost his title to Leon Spinks, but regained it in a rematch with Spinks later that same year, becoming the first boxer to win the championship three times. Ali retired with the title but returned to the ring in 1980 to face the new champion, Larry Holmes. Ali was unsuccessful and retired permanently in 1981. Ali retired from professional boxing with an overall professional record of 56-5. Over the course of his 61 fights, Muhammad Ali introduced boxing to audiences around the world. Althought the majority of his engagements were in the United States, he fought in matches in Bahamas, Germany, Philippines, Malaysia, Zaire, Indonesia, Ireland, Canada, Japan, Switzerland and Great Britain. He successfully defended his title before a mostly international audience in San Juan, Puerto Rico in 1976. By the end of his career Ali was the most well-known athlete in the world. In the early 1980s Muhammad Ali was diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease. Nevertheless in 1985 he participated in the negotiations for the release of kidnapped Americans in Lebanon. During his lifetime, Ali has also received numerous honors and awards for his humanitarian work. The Olympic committee selected him to light the Olympic flame for the 1996 games in Atlanta, Georgia. During that event he received a replacement gold medal for the one he received in 1960 that he tossed in the Ohio River in disgust over a racial incident. In 2005 he also received the Presidential Medal of Freedom at the White House. That same year, for his work in the civil rights movement, the former boxer was awarded the prestigious Otto Hahn freedom medal by the German Society for the United Nations. The Muhammad Ali Center opened in his hometown of Louisville in 2005. The facility displays Ali’s boxing memorabilia and showcases themes of civil rights, social responsibility, respect, and personal growth. Ali was married four times and has nine children. The boxer spent the remaining years of his life in Scottsdale, Arizona with his fourth wife, Yolanda “Lonnie” Ali. He died on June 3, 2016 in Scottsdale at the age of 74.",

        "summary": "Born into slavery in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on February 14, 1760, Richard Allen went on to become an educator, writer, minister and founder of the African Methodist Episcopal Church. Benjamin Chew, a Quaker lawyer, owned the Allen family, which included Richard’s parents and three other children. Chew eventually sold the Allen family to Stokeley Sturgis, a Delaware planter. At age 17 Allen was converted to Methodism by an itinerant preacher. Allen’s master, Stokeley Sturgis, was said to have been influenced by Allen to become a Methodist as well. After his conversion, Sturgis offered his slaves the opportunity to buy their way out of slavery. In 1783, by working at odd jobs for five years, Allen managed to purchase his freedom for $2,000. In the meantime, Allen began to preach in Methodist churches and meetings in the Baltimore area. Through his Methodist connections Allen was invited to return to Philadelphia in 1786. Upon arriving in the city he joined St. George’s Methodist Episcopal Church, where he became active in teaching and preaching. As the number of African Americans attending St. George’s increased, racial tensions mounted. Allen preached at 5:00 a.m. in special services on Sunday mornings to approximately 50 African American Methodists. When they attended the regular morning service, segregated seating was instituted. With this segregation Allen became convinced that a separate church was necessary for the black congregants. In 1787 Allen and a number of other African American Methodists walked out and formed a separate church that would become Bethel African Methodist Episcopal Church, the first Methodist church in the United States specifically for African Americans. Seven years later, on July 29, 1794, Bethel was dedicated by Bishop Francis Asbury. Richard Allen served Bethel Church as its pastor, and he was ordained a deacon by Asbury in 1799. Other African American Methodist churches were formed in New York, New Jersey, Delaware and Maryland. On April 9, 1816, after two decades of conflict with white Methodism, Allen and other African American Methodist preachers hosted a meeting in Philadelphia to bring these churches together and to form a new denomination, the African Methodist Episcopal Church (AME). Allen was elected bishop, and with his consecration became the first African American bishop in the United States. By the time Allen died at his home on March 26, 1831, the AME church was well-established in the United States and supported missions in several countries overseas. Allen cared passionately about education and opened a day school for African American children. He abhorred slavery, worked actively for abolition, and maintained his home as a stop on the Underground Railroad. He was committed to self-determination for African Americans in the United States, and eventually opposed all colonization plans for African Americans in other countries.",

        "summary": "Marian Anderson, renowned contralto and one of the most celebrated singers of the 20th century, was born on February 27, 1897, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Anderson was the daughter of John Berkley Anderson, a small business owner, and Annie Delilah Rucker Anderson, a former Virginia schoolteacher. Anderson grew up in Philadelphia and began performing by the age of 10 when she joined the People’s Chorus led by Emma Azalia Hackley. Anderson graduated from South Philadelphia High School in 1921 and attempted to enroll in the Philadelphia Music Academy (now the University of the Arts) but was rejected because of her race. She then pursued private studies with prominent music instructors, Giuseppe Boghetti and Agnes Reifsnyder. In 1925, at the age of 28, Anderson won first prize in a singing competition sponsored by the New York Philharmonic and afterwards remained in New York to pursue private studies. In 1928, she sang for the first time at Carnegie Hall. Two years later she made her European debut at Wigmore Hall in London, England. Anderson spent the early 1930s touring Europe, but she returned to the United States in 1935 to make her fist recital appearance at Town Hall in New York City. By the late 1930s Anderson was a highly acclaimed concert performer giving about seventy recitals a year. Despite her fame she was not allowed to eat at certain restaurants or stay in certain hotels while on tour. In response, Albert Einstein hosted her at his home each time she visited the Princeton University area. In 1939, the Daughters of the American Revolution (DAR) refused permission to Anderson to sing to a racially integrated audience in its Constitution Hall. In the ensuing furor, First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt resigned her membership in the DAR and along with Walter White of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) began a campaign to have Anderson perform on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial. That concert took place on April 9, 1939 with Anderson opening the program with “My Country ‘Tis of Thee.” More than 75,000 people attended her concert. Anderson entertained American troops during both World War II and the Korean War. In 1943, she finally sang before an integrated audience at Constitution Hall at the invitation of the DAR. On July 17, 1943, Anderson married architect Orpheus H. Fisher. Three years earlier, in 1940, Anderson and Fisher purchased a 100 acre farm near Danbury, Connecticut, which became Anderson’s home for the next half century. The property, called Marianna Farm, included an acoustic rehearsal studio. Anderson continued to make firsts. On January 7, 1955 she became the first African American to perform with the Metropolitan Opera in New York City. One year later, she published her autobiography, My Lord, What a Morning. In 1957, Anderson sang at the inauguration of President Dwight D. Eisenhower, who later made her a goodwill ambassador. In 1958, she officially became a US delegate to the United Nations. Anderson also sang at the John F. Kennedy presidential inauguration in 1961. By this point, Anderson was also an active supporter of the civil rights movement, giving benefit concerts for the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) and the NAACP. In 1963, Anderson sang at the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom. The same year, she was one of the original 31 recipients of the newly re-instituted Presidential Medal of Freedom. Anderson began her farewell tour at Constitution Hall on October 24, 1964. It ended at Carnegie Hall on April 18, 1965. Marian Anderson had over 1,500 songs in her repertoire, sang in nine languages, and performed on four continents. She received national honors throughout her life including the NAACP’s Spingarn Medal in 1939, the United Nations Peace Prize in 1977, and a Grammy Award for Lifetime Achievement in 1991. In 1980, the United States Treasury coined a half ounce gold medal with her likeness, and in 2005 a commemorative postage stamp was issued in her honor. On April 8, 1993, Marian Anderson died in Portland, Oregon at the home of her nephew, conductor James DePriest. She was 96 years old.",

At the age of four Maya and her brother were sent to live with their grandmother in Stamps, Arkansas. A couple of years later they moved back to St. Louis to live with their mother, but were soon returned to Stamps after Maya was molested by her mother’s boyfriend and turned mute. After her return to Stamps Maya Johnson began to read voraciously and listen intently to everything that happened around her. By high school, her voice had returned. Johnson, then 15, and her brother were reunited with their mother who was now living in San Francisco, California. One year later she graduated from high school while pregnant. In the years after her son, Clyde, was born Johnson worked variously as cook, dancer, driver, and singer. She was also married briefly in 1952 to Anastasios Angelopulos, a Greek sailor. In 1954 Johnson became a professional actor when she joined the traveling production of Porgy and Bess. She adopted the name Maya Angelou by combining her nickname with a shortened version of her ex-husband’s last name. After visiting 22 countries for performances, Angelou quit the show after her son became ill. She and Clyde returned briefly to San Francisco but then moved to New York City where she joined the Harlem Writers Guild to hone her writing skills. In 1960, Angelou left the United States to reside briefly in Cairo, Egypt with her new husband South African freedom fighter Vusumzi Make. While abroad, she learned to speak French, Spanish, Italian, Arabic, and the West African language Fanti, fluently. The couple soon separated and Angelou moved to Ghana. While there, she befriended former of Nation of Islam leader Malcolm X on his visit to Africa and embraced his black nationalist philosophy. Angelou returned to the United States in 1964 anticipating helping Malcolm X develop his new Organization of African American Unity (OAAU). However, Malcolm X was assassinated in March 1965 and the OAAU dissolved. Angelou continued to participate in the black freedom struggle, working with Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., and serving as the Northern Coordinator for the Southern Christian Leadership Conference until his assassination in 1968. At the age of 38, at the urging of James Baldwin, Angelou began writing a series of autobiographical books including I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings (1970), her most famous work, as well as Gather Together in My Name (1974), Singin’ and Swingin’ and Gettin’ Merry Like Christmas (1976), The Heart of a Woman (1981), and All God’s Children Need Traveling Shoes (1986). In 2002, she authored A Song Flung Up to Heaven and in 2008 she narrated the award-winning documentary The Black Candle, and published a book for young women, Letter to My Daughter. Angelou also appeared on television and in movies including the highly acclaimed television miniseries, Roots (1977), Poetic Justice (1993), and Tyler Perry’s Madea’s Family Reunion (2006). In 1996 she directed her first full length feature film, Down in the Delta. Angelou has received numerous honors and awards for her lifetime of achievement. In 1971, her book of poetry, Just Give Me a Cool Drink of Water ‘fore I Die, earned her a Pulitzer Prize nomination. She also became the first black woman to recite poetry at a presidential inauguration (William Jefferson Clinton, 1993) and only the second poet (after Robert Frost at the John Kennedy inauguration in 1961), to be invited to participate in an inauguration. In 2000, Angelou received the Presidential Medal of the Arts and in 2008, she received the Ford’s Theatre Lincoln Medal. On February 15, 2011, President Barack Obama awarded Angelou the Presidential Medal of Freedom at a White House Ceremony. The Medal is the nation’s highest civilian honor.

At the age of four, he began playing tennis at Brook Field, a black-only park where his father worked as caretaker. Before she died in 1950, Ashe’s mother taught him the importance of education. His father sponsored his early development in tennis. Ashe developed into a prodigy in the early 1950s under his lifelong coach Dr. Walter Johnson, who also trained professional tennis player and golfer Althea Gibson. In 1953, at the age of 10, Ashe won the American Tennis Association’s National Championship for boys 12 years and under. Determined to play in the all-white Junior United States Tennis Association (USTA), Ashe broke its racial barrier in 1957 when he competed in Maryland boys’ championships. This led to his regular inclusion in local summer USTA tournaments from 1957 to 1960. In 1960, 17-year-old Ashe first gained national recognition as a high school student-athlete in Sports Illustrated. The following year, he entered the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) on a full scholarship. In Ashe’s sophomore year, he made the 1963 US Davis Cup team, a feat he repeated from 1964 to 1970 and again in 1975, 1976 and 1978. In 1965, Ashe was named the top-ranked amateur player in men’s tennis and, as team captain, guided the UCLA tennis team to the NCAA team championship, winning the individual and doubles titles. From 1966 to 1969, Ashe was a commissioned officer in the army. He was assigned to the US Military Academy at West Point, New York. In 1969, he first spoke out against South African apartheid which he saw as an extension of his fight against Jim Crow in the United States. From that date he became one of the most outspoken opponents of apartheid, constantly using his own success to challenge South Africa. In 1973, he forced concessions which led to his inclusion in the 1973 South African Open. Ashe became a professional tennis player in 1969. In that year he became the first African American to be ranked number one, a feat repeated in 1975 after he won Wimbledon. Ashe emerged as a leader among professional tennis players, co-founding the USTA National Junior Tennis League, which exposed inner-city youth to tennis, and the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP). Ashe served as its president in 1974 following a 78-person boycott of Wimbledon. In 1977, Ashe married photographer Jeanne Moutoussamy. Nine years later they had their only child, a daughter named Camera. Heart complications stemming from a 1979 heart attack forced Ashe to retire from professional tennis in 1980, with a career record of 818 wins, 260 losses, and 51 titles. In 1985, he was unanimously elected into the International Tennis Hall of Fame. After his tennis career ended, Ashe became a noted journalist, humanitarian, and activist. In 1981 he became the first African American to be named national chairman of the American Heart Association. As a journalist he wrote for Tennis Magazine, Time Magazine and The Washington Post. Ashe was also a tennis commentator for ABC Sports and HBO Sports. He wrote eight books between 1967 and 1995 covering topics such as education, tennis, and African American achievement. He continued his fight against apartheid and in 1983 became the co-founder of Artists and Athletes Against Apartheid. Ashe was a member of Kappa Alpha Psi and Sigma Pi Phi fraternities. In the early 1990s, Ashe became an ambassador for AIDS awareness. His concern about AIDS began with his HIV infection from a tainted blood transfusion during 1983 bypass surgery. By 1988 the infection had progressed from HIV into full-blown AIDS. The family publicly disclosed his condition on April 8, 1992, at a press conference. Nearly a year later, on February 6, 1993, Arthur Robert Ashe Jr. died from AIDS-related pneumonia at New York Hospital in New York City. His body lay in state at the governor’s mansion in his native Richmond, an unprecedented honor for an African American, and the first person to lie in state at the mansion since Confederate General Stonewall Jackson in 1863. Posthumously, Ashe has been commemorated with many awards. Most notable are the Presidential Medal of Freedom (1993), a statute on Richmond’s Monument Avenue (1996), and, beginning in 1997, the US Open has been played in Arthur Ashe Stadium in Flushing Meadows Park, New York. Ashe was also honored with a US postage stamp in 2005.",

        "summary": "Crispus Attucks, the first martyr of the Boston Massacre in 1770, was probably born near Framingham, Massachusetts, a Christianized and multitribal town of Indians, whites, and blacks, in 1723. Unusually tall for the era at six feet, two inches, Attucks was of mixed ancestry, the son of an African American man and an American Indian woman. It is believed that he was the slave of William Brown since he was reported in the Boston Gazette on October 2, 1750 as having escaped from Brown; Attucks was listed as age 27 at the time. By the time of the Massacre he was 47 and working as a sailor in Boston and around the Atlantic Basin. By 1770, the colonists of Boston had been harassed by the British soldiers known as the “Redcoats.” Tired of the harassment, on March 5, 1770, Crispus Attucks and his compatriots marched up to the King Streets Custom House with banners calling for independence from England. They allegedly threatened the British guards with clubs, chunks of ice, and rocks. What actually happened in the confrontation between the colonists and the British soldiers is debatable. What is known is that “[a] group of citizens, apparently led by a tall robust man with a dark face appeared on the scene” and confronted the eight British soldiers. The soldiers fired and Attucks and three other men, Samuel Gray, Samuel Maverick, and James Caldwell, were killed. On November 27, 1770, the soldiers were tried in a Boston court for murder. During the trial it was reported that Attucks fell first with one bullet lodged in his right chest. He was shot by the British soldier William Warren. Six of the eight British soldiers were acquitted on the grounds of self-defense while the remaining two received a conviction of a lesser charge than manslaughter. John Adams, who would become the second president of the United States, suppressed his own desire for independence from the British in order to give the soldiers legal representation he felt they deserved. By the time of the Revolution the Boston Massacre was already enshrined in memory as the first deadly confrontation in the struggle for American independence from the British. Religious and political leaders gave sermons and speeches commemorating the “fallen ones” in the massacre. Freed African Americans in Massachusetts, inspired by Attucks’ heroism, began to successfully petition for their freedom. By the 1850s, African Americans had long hailed Attucks as a Revolutionary patriot and as a symbol of loyalty, black citizenship, and racial pride. His service to the nation provided arguments for the abolitionists in their quest to end the institution of slavery. On March 5, 1858, just prior to the Civil War, prominent black Boston abolitionists William C. Nell and Lewis Hayden, invoked Attucks’ actions again when they established a Crispus Attucks Day with a festival at Faneuil Hall. In 1998, the United States minted a coin in honor of Attucks to mark the 275th anniversary of his birth and to celebrate African American Revolutionary patriots. Today, African Americans remember Attucks’ life through Attucks Day Celebrations, organizations and institutions bearing his name, and a monument to him on the Boston Common.",

        "summary": "James Arthur Baldwin, fiction writer, essayist, dramatist, and poet, was born on August 2, 1924 in Harlem, New York during the Harlem Renaissance. After graduating from DeWitt Clinton High School in the Bronx in 1942, he began his formal career as a writer. Baldwin was inspired by Richard Wright, despite his being called to the ministry at age fourteen in the Pentecostal faith and church dominated by his father, David Baldwin. Although James Baldwin emerged as a major American literary voice by 1953 when he published his first novel, Go Tell It on the Mountain, his candid and militant essays found in Nobody Knows my Name (1961) and The Fire Next Time (1963) identified his writing with the emerging Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s. Baldwin stood with Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. at the Lincoln Memorial in 1963, when the civil rights leader delivered his “I Have a Dream” speech. Like John Grimes, the protagonist of his autobiographical novel, Go Tell it on the Mountain, Baldwin struggled with his racial, sexual, and spiritual identities. In his second novel, Giovanni’s Room (1956), he seeks to illustrate through his treatment and characterization of his main characters the validity of homosexual love. Baldwin also unabashedly explores the spectrum and complexity of heterosexual and homosexual love in Another Country (1962). Identifying himself as “a lover born in a loveless world,” Baldwin’s themes of race, sexual orientation, and the multifaceted power of love remained the central focus of his other novels and stories including Going to Meet the Man (1965), Tell Me How Long the Train’s Been Gone (1968), If Beale Street Could Talk (1974), and his last novel, Just Above My Head (1979). Baldwin was considered by many literary critics to be a better essayist than novelist. His work appeared regularly in such mainstream literary magazines as Harper’s, The New Yorker, Esquire, and Partisan Review. His elegant, graceful, and candid prose; as well as his provocative socio-politically indicting voice in essays such as “Everybody’s Protest Novel,” “The Fire Next Time,” “Nobody Knows My Name,” and “No Name in the Street,” placed him in the vanguard of the most important mid twentieth-century American writers. James Baldwin also authored two plays, The Amen Corner (1968) and Blues for Mister Charlie (1964), and published a collection of poems, Jimmy’s Blues (1985). His collections of essays include Notes of a Native Son (1955), Nobody Knows My Name (1961), The Fire Next Time (1963), No Name in the Streets (1972), The Devil Finds Work (1976), and The Evidence of Things Not Seen (1985). Baldwin’s work addressed major aspects of the black experience. His themes, ranging from black church culture to the antipathy between the police and black urban male dwellers, were celebrated and critiqued in Baldwin’s collected work. Baldwin also made music—jazz, blues, and gospel—a central force in the world of his characters. James Arthur Baldwin died in France, his adopted home, in 1987, and where he had once noted that for the first time he had been called simply “an American.” Baldwin had lived in France from 1948 to 1962 when he returned to the United States to participate in the Civil Rights Movement. After the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King Baldwin returned permanently to Europe to escape the racism and homophobia that threatened to suffocate his life in the United States.",

        "summary": "Benjamin Banneker, free black, farmer, mathematician, and astronomer, was born on November 9, 1731, the son of freed slaves Robert and Mary Bannaky, probably near the Patapsco River southeast of Baltimore, Maryland, where his father owned a small farm. For some years, Benjamin seems to have served as an indentured laborer on the Prince George’s County plantation of Mary Welsh, who had dealings with the Bannaky family and in 1773 executed her dead husband’s instructions to release several of her labor force including “Negro Ben, born free age 43.” Walsh was surely not Banneker’s grandmother, as argued by many biographers, but she did leave him a substantial legacy. He then lived alone as a tobacco farmer near the Patapsco River. By tradition, Banneker received only a brief education from a Quaker schoolmaster. But he showed an early talent for mathematics and construction when, aged 21, he built a model of a striking clock, largely out of wood, that became renowned in his neighborhood. He read widely and recorded his researches. His skills drew him into contact with a wealthy white family, the Ellicotts, who had established flourmills and an iron foundry on the outskirts of Baltimore in the mid-1770s. In 1788, George Ellicott, a keen amateur astronomer, lent Banneker books and instruments that enabled him to construct tables predicting the positions of the stars and future solar and lunar eclipses. Three years later, Andrew Ellicott hired Banneker to assist him in surveying the boundaries of the ten-mile square site of the future Federal capital of Washington, D.C. In that year, too, Banneker won the backing of several Philadelphia, Pennsylvania supporters of the anti-slavery cause to print his work in the popular form of an almanac. Its 1792 publication, introduced by letters pointing out how Banneker’s accomplishments disproved the myth of Negro inferiority, was a considerable success and produced twenty-seven further editions of “Banneker’s Almanac” over the next five years. Banneker sent a manuscript copy of his work to Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson along with a plea against the continuance of black slavery and received a courteous, if evasive, reply. But Jefferson praised Banneker as “a very respectable mathematician” in forwarding the manuscript to the notice of the French Academy of Sciences. Banneker continued to live on his farm, in declining health, and died on October 9, 1806. Only fragments of his later writings survive, as most perished in a fire after his death. His life and work have become enshrouded in legend and anecdote. But his achievements ranked him among other American scientists of the time, and they were the more remarkable as the product of patient, lifelong self-education, emerging out of humble origins.",

        "summary": "Everett Leroi Jones, poet, playwright, activist, and educator, was born on October 7, 1934, in Newark, New Jersey to Coyt Leverrette Jones and Anna Lois Jones. He attended primary and secondary schools in Newark and in 1954 he earned a B.A. in English from Howard University. Jones joined the military that same year, serving three years in the Air Force as a gunner. Following his honorable discharge, Jones he settled in Greenwich Village in lower Manhattan where he socialized with Beatnik artists, musicians, and writers. While living in the Village, he also met and married Hettie Cohen, a Jewish writer. The couple co-edited the progressive literary magazine Yugen. They also founded Totem Press, which published the works of Allen Ginsberg, Jack Kerouac, and other political activists. Jones’s own early writings often reflected issues of racial and national identity. His first book of poetry, Preface to a Twenty Volume Suicide Note appeared in 1961. In 1963, he published other progressive books like the Blues People: Negro Music in White America and The Moderns: An Anthology of New Writing in America. As the civil rights movement intensified, Jones’s work as a playwright began to reflect his growing distrust of white America. Following the moderate success of his plays The Slave (1961) and The Toilet (1962), his reputation as playwright reached a new level with his 1964 off Broadway play Dutchman. The highly acclaimed, but controversial, production won an Obie Award for “best off-Broadway play” and became a film. Following the assassination of Malcolm X in 1965, Jones renounced his bohemian lifestyle and divorced Hettie. He moved uptown to Harlem, and helped usher in the Black Arts Movement by founding the Black Arts Repertory Theatre/School (BARTS) which produced plays for black audiences. After the school closed in 1967, he returned to Newark and married African American poet Sylvia Robinson (Amina Baraka). The couple founded the Spirit House Players, which produced Baraka’s anti-police brutality plays. During the late 1960s Jones converted to Islam, changing his name to Amiri Baraka. He also embraced black nationalist themes and organizations such as US in Los Angeles, California. He later served as Secretary-General of the National Black Political Assembly and Chairman of the Congress of African People, a Pan Africanist organization. In 1972 Baraka became one of the lead organizers of the National Black Political Convention held in Gary, Indiana. By the mid 1970s Baraka underwent another philosophical change and became a Marxist, supporting the overthrow of capitalism. During Baraka’s career, some of his writings have been criticized as being homophobic, sexist, and anti Semitic. His post published 911 poem “Somebody Blew Up America” caused such a controversy that New Jersey Governor Jim McGreevey abolished Baraka’s title of New Jersey Poet Laureate in 2002. However, that same year, in a political compromise, state officials bestowed on the artist the title of poet laureate of the Newark Public Schools. Baraka’s numerous literary honors and awards include the Guggenheim Foundation, the Langston Hughes Award from the City College of New York, the Rockefeller Foundation Award for Drama, and induction into the American Academy of Arts and Letters. After serving as a visiting professor at several universities, including the New School for Social Research, San Francisco State University, Yale, and George Washington University, Baraka in 1985 began teaching in the Africana Studies Department at the State University of New York in Stony Brook where he remained for two decades. Baraka was Professor Emeritus at Stony Brook and in the first decade of the 21st Century resided in Newark where he was co-director of Kimako’s Blues People, a community arts center.

        "occupation": "Educator",
        "summary": "Mary McLeod Bethune was a prominent educator, political leader, and social visionary whose early twentieth century activism for black women and civil rights laid the foundation for the modern civil rights era. Inspired by leaders such as Ida B. Wells-Barnett and Josephine St. Pierre-Ruffin, Bethune mobilized African American women’s organizations to challenge racial injustice and demand first class citizenship. Mary Jane McLeod was born on July 10, 1875, the fifteenth of seventeen children of Samuel and Patsy McIntosh McLeod, former slaves in Maysville, South Carolina. As a child, she quickly discovered the value of education. Unlike her parents and all but two of her siblings, Bethune was born free and was formally educated at the Maysville School, a Presbyterian Mission School for African Americans. Shortly after her graduation in 1886, Bethune continued her education on a scholarship at the Scotia Seminary for Girls (now Barber-Scotia College) in Concord, North Carolina. Upon graduation in 1894, Bethune initially planned to become a Christian missionary in Africa. After teaching and working among South Carolina blacks, however, she realized that “Africans in America needed Christ and school just as much as Negroes in Africa… My life work lay not in Africa but in my own country.” In 1898, at the age of 23, Mary McLeod married Albertus Bethune. The marriage lasted less than a decade because Albertus deserted the family in 1907. The couple had one son, Albert McLeod Bethune. Juggling family and work, Mary McLeod Bethune taught in Georgia, South Carolina, Florida and Illinois between 1895 and 1903, before settling in Daytona, Florida. Beginning in 1904, she opened a high school, hospital, and the Daytona Normal and Industrial Institute for Negro Girls. The popularity of Daytona Normal led to its merging with the Methodist-run Cookman Institute for Men in Jacksonville in 1923, thus becoming the Bethune-Cookman College. Bethune served as the merged college’s first president from 1923 to 1942 and again from 1946 to 1947. She was, at the time, one of the few female college presidents in the nation. While establishing crucial educational institutions, Bethune began decades of leadership among women’s groups when she was elected President of the Florida Federation of Colored Women in 1917. In 1924, she was elected president of the National Association of Colored Women (NACW) which was founded by St. Pierre-Ruffin in 1896. As NACW president, Bethune tried to steer it beyond traditional self-help and moral uplift toward the politics of agitation for integration by attacking racial discrimination and segregation in the Federal government. Frustrated by the difficulty of eliminating Jim Crow in the US government and the internal politics of the NACW, Bethune left the Association in 1935 and founded the National Council of Negro Women (NCNW), an organization with a more explicit civil rights agenda. Bethune’s friendship with First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt was one of the reasons for the creation of the NCNW. That friendship led to Bethune becoming the Director of the National Youth Administration’s (NYA) Division of Negro Affairs, a post she held from 1936 to 1943. As director, she led an organization that trained tens of thousands of black youth for skilled positions that eventually became available in defense plants during World War II. She made sure black colleges participated in the Civilian Pilot Training Program which graduated some of the nation’s first black pilots. Through the NYA, Bethune became the most prominent African American in Pres. Franklin Roosevelt’s administration and because of her friendship with Mrs. Roosevelt, she influenced government policy in the 1930s. She was also the chair of the informal Black Cabinet of senior African American officials in the Roosevelt administration. Bethune was instrumental in integrating the Red Cross, increasing public awareness of lynching, voter discrimination in federal elections, and segregation on interstate trains and buses. In 1949, President Harry S. Truman appointed her to lead the US delegation to Liberia to observe the inauguration of President William V.S. Tubman. In 1951, she served on President Truman’s Committee of Twelve for National Defense. Mary McLeod Bethune died of a heart attack on May 18, 1955, at the age of 79. She lived long enough to see the US Supreme Court strike down de jure school segregation in Brown v. Board of Education, but she died seven months before the beginning of the Montgomery Bus Boycott, which ushered in the modern Civil Rights Movement.",

He flew the space shuttle, conducted experiments and helped launch a $45 million satellite to provide communications and weather information for India. President Ronald Reagan called the space shuttle during their mission and told Bluford “You will serve as a role model for so many others and be so inspirational.” Bluford flew a total of four missions in space and continued with NASA until 1993. He received an M.B.A. from the University of Houston while still serving in 1987, and became the Vice President of a computer software company in Maryland after retiring. Bluford broke the color line of space. In less than five months after his first launch in 1983, Ronald E. McNair would be the second African American in space and by 1992 Mae Jemison would be the first African American female in space.",

        "summary": "Hoping for a much better life outside the racially oppressive South and Alexandria, Louisiana where Arnaud Wendell Bontemps was born on October 13, 1902, the middle class Bontemps family moved to the Watts community just south of Los Angeles. They soon abandoned Catholicism and became devout Seventh Day Adventists. Bontemps’ mother was a schoolteacher and his father, a bricklayer, was determined to have the family assimilate into the dominant white culture. In 1923, Bontemps graduated from Pacific Union College, an Adventist school in California, and found work in the US Post Office. He next used his church connections to secure a teaching job at the Harlem Academy in New York City in 1924. Bontemps’ arrival in the metropolis coincided with the height of the Harlem Renaissance and—inspired by the creative energy that surrounded him, and encouraged by his associates—over the next three years he wrote poetry that garnered the Alexander Pushkin Prize from Opportunity, the journal of the National Urban League) and the Poetry Prize from The Crisis, the publication of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). Married in 1926 to a former student, Bontemps published his first novel, God Sends Sunday (1931), a racy tale of a jockey’s hectic life based on some of the true experiences of his Uncle Buddy, was followed by the award-winning “A Summer Tragedy” (1932), a broadly anthologized, unsentimental short story concerning elderly married Mississippi Delta sharecroppers who commit suicide. During this period he forged lasting friendships with Langston Hughes and Countee Cullen. Eventually, the Great Depression dispersed talented Harlemites like Bontemps who returned to the South to teach in the early 1930s at Oakwood Junior College, another Adventist school. Considered a pioneer among African American historical fiction writers, Bontemps authored the best known of his novels, the critically-acclaimed Black Thunder (1936), which was based on the actual event of a slave revolt in Virginia led by Gabriel Prosser in 1800. Bontemps was largely responsible for bringing to prominence the genre of African American children’s literature with Popo and Fifina: Children of Haiti (1932) and subsequent works. In 1938 he penned his final novel, Drums at Dusk (1939). Disappointing sales and mixed reviews of the novel persuaded him to concentrate even more on literature for young readers until the 1960s, when he published Personals (1965), a collection of poetry, and wrote the introduction to a paperback edition of Black Thunder in 1968. Upon earning a master’s degree in library science at the University of Chicago in 1943, Bontemps began 21 years of distinguished service at Fisk University where he was professor and head librarian. The Broadway musical St. Louis Woman, based on his first novel, premiered in 1946, and he collaborated with Langston Hughes to publish The Poetry of the Negro in 1949. In the decade of the 1950s Bontemps wrote biographies aimed at young people. He teamed up again with Hughes to co-edit The Book of Negro Folklore (1959). In the late 1960s he taught at the University of Illinois at Chicago Circle and briefly was curator of the James Weldon Johnson Collection at the Beinecke Library at Yale University. Bontemps was a member of Sigma Pi Phi fraternity. Bontemps’ final book was The Harlem Renaissance Remembered (1972). Among his honors and awards were two Julius Rosenwald Fellowships and two Guggenheim Fellowships; the Jane Addams Children’s Book Award in 1956 for The Story of the Negro (1948); and honorary doctorates from Morgan State University and Berea College. While a writer-in-residence at Fisk collecting his short fiction for publication, he died at his home in Nashville, Tennessee on June 4, 1973. He was 70 at the time of his death.",

        "fun_fact": "In 1933, while researching for what has since become his most renowned novel, Black Thunder, Arna Bontemps was given an ultimatum by his employer, the head of the Huntsville, Alabama, Seventh-Day Adventist school. The headmaster demanded publicly that Bontemps burn most of the books in his small personal library if he wished to continue teaching there. Burning works by Frederick Douglass, W. E. B. DuBois, and Claude McKay, the headmaster believed, would prove to the world that Bontemps had no connection to the widespread protests surrounding the nearby Scottsboro trials, in which five young black men were falsely accused and later convicted of raping two young white women."

        "summary": "Edward William Brooke III was the first African American to be elected by popular vote to the United States Senate. Brooke, an African American, Protestant Republican, won elective office in the overwhelmingly white, Catholic, Democratic state of Massachusetts and emerged as a leader in the U.S. Senate. Edward Brooke III, the son of Helen (Seldon) Brooke and Edward W. Brooke, was born October 26, 1919 in Washington, D.C. Brook’s father, Edward, earned a law degree at the Howard University School of Law and later served as an attorney with the US Veterans Administration. After his graduation from Howard University in 1941, Edward Brooke III served as an officer in the Army with the all-African American 366th Combat Infantry Regiment. He fought in Italy during World War II and won a Bronze Star for leading an attack on a German artillery battery. While in Italy, he met his first wife, Remigia Ferrari-Scacco. After serving as a combat officer, Brooke entered Boston University Law School and graduated in 1948. Although Brooke did not vote prior to the age of 30, his friends were able to persuade him to enter politics. Brooke ran in both Democratic and Republican primaries in 1950 for the Massachusetts legislature. He lost the Democratic nomination but won the Republican nod. He was defeated in general elections for the legislature in 1950 and in 1952. In 1960, he ran as the Republican candidate for Secretary of State, becoming the first African American in Massachusetts to be nominated for a statewide office. He received over one million votes but lost by fewer than 12,000 to Kevin White. In his fourth try for elective office, Brooke won the Attorney General’s race in 1962, becoming the first elected African American Attorney General of any state in American history. He won again in 1964. As Attorney General, Brooke gained a reputation as a vigorous prosecutor of organized crime and for his coordination of local police departments in the highly publicized Boston Strangler case between 1962 and 1964. In 1966 Brooke ran for the US Senate, defeating former Governor Endicott Peabody. He served two terms in the Senate from January 3, 1967, to January 3, 1979. While in the Senate, Brooke co-authored the 1968 Fair Housing Act. Brooke also supported anti-poverty legislation and called for strengthening Social Security, increasing the minimum wage, and funding Medicare. In 1969, Brooke broke ranks with President Richard Nixon, a fellow Republican, because he believed the President’s Supreme Court nominee Clement Haynsworth was a segregationist. Brooke led a bipartisan coalition that defeated Haynsworth’s nomination. A few months later he again organized sufficient Republican support to defeat Nixon’s second Supreme Court nominee, Harold Carswell, who had also voiced support for racial segregation. On November 4, 1973, Brooke became the first Republican to call on President Nixon to resign because of the Watergate Scandal. Brooke divorced his first wife in 1978 and married Anne Fleming in 1979. After leaving the Senate he practiced law in Washington, D.C. In 2004, Edward William Brooke III was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President George W. Bush and in 2009 he received the Congressional Gold Medal. Edward Brooke died in his Coral Gables, Florida, home on January 3, 2015. He was 95.",

        "summary": "Gwendolyn Elizabeth Brooks, born June 7, 1917 in Topeka, Kansas, moved to Chicago, Illinois where she was reared and launched her literary career. Marrying Henry Blakely in 1939, the couple had two children. Brooks’s formal education consists of an associate degree in literature and arts from Wilson Junior College but she has also received over seventy honorary degrees from several leading universities. In her early years, Brooks served as the director of publicity for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) in Chicago. Individual poems published in the Chicago Defender during her high school years preceded Brooks’s first collection of poetry, A Street in Bronzeville (1945). This book focused on “community consciousness.” Brooks’s Annie Allen was published in 1949 with a focus on “self-realization” and “artistic sensibility” of a young black woman. That volume made her the first African American to be awarded the Pulitzer Prize in poetry. The Bean Eater, her third book, was released in 1960. Brooks published Selected Poems in 1963, In the Mecca (1968), Riot (1969), Family Pictures (1970), and Beckoning (1975). During this period, she began to publish her work through small black-run presses such as Broadside in Chicago. In the Mecca, one of her most important works of that period, describes a rather exquisite apartment building built in 1891 but leveled in 1952 after it had become a run-down tenement building. This collection, like others in the late 1960s and early 1970s, reflected the rising call for a literature for black people that spoke out against white oppression. Brooks continued to write poetry into the 1980s. Her Primer for Blacks (1980), To Disembark (1981), Black Love (1982), The Near-Johannesburg Boy (1986), Blacks (1987), Gottschalk and the Grand Tarantelle (1988), Winnie (1988), and Children Coming Home (1991), all emerged during this period. Brooks also wrote one work of long fiction, Maud Martha (1953). Her nonfiction works included The World of Gwendolyn Brooks (1971), Report from Part One (1972), Young Poet’s Primer (1980), Report from Part Two (1996). Brooks’s children’s books included three publications: Bronzeville Boys and Girl (1956), The Tiger Who Wore White Gloves (1974), and Very Young Poets (1983). During her lifetime, Brooks received numerous honors and served in several prestigious capacities including appointment as poet laureate of Illinois (1968), poetry consultant for the Library of Congress (1985), honorary fellow of the Modern Language Association (1987), two-time winner of the Guggenheim Fellowship, member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters, Jefferson Lecturer for Distinguished Intellectual Achievement in the Humanities (1994), and recipient of the National Medal of Art (1995).

        "occupation": "Former United States Senator",
        "summary": "Blanche K. Bruce (1841-1898) was the first African American to serve a full term as a United States Senator. In February 1874, the Mississippi legislature elected Bruce to the U.S. Senate. Bruce focused on a number of state and national issues including the construction of levees along the Mississippi River, the development of a more humane and equitable federal Indian policy and the desegregation of the United States Army. However one of his most memorable addresses in Congress occurred in March 1876 when he called for a Senate investigation of the racial and political violence that marked the Mississippi gubernatorial election of 1875. That speech appears below. The conduct of the late election in Mississippi affected not merely the fortunes of partisans—as the same were necessarily involved in the defeat or success of the respective parties to the contest—but put in question and jeopardy the sacred rights of the citizens; and the investigation contemplated in the pending resolution has for its object not the determination of the question whether the offices shall be held and the public affairs of that State be administered by democrats or republicans, but the higher and more important end, the protection in all their purity and significance of the political rights of the people and the free institutions of the country. The evidence in hand and accessible will show beyond peradventure that in many parts of the State corrupt and violent influences were brought to bear upon the registrars of voters, thus materially affecting the character of the voting or poll lists; upon the inspectors of election, prejudicially and unfairly thereby changing the number of votes cast; and, finally, threats and violence were practiced directly upon the masses of voters in such measures and strength as to produce grave apprehensions for their personal safety and as to deter them from the exercise of their political franchises. It will not accord with the laws of nature or history to brand colored people a race of cowards. On more than one historic field, beginning in 1776 and coming down to this centennial year of the Republic, they have attested in blood their courage as well as a love of liberty. I ask Senators to believe that no consideration of fear or personal danger has kept us quiet and forbearing under the provocations and wrongs that have so sorely tried our souls. But feeling kindly toward our white fellow-citizens, appreciating the good purposes and politics of the better classes, and, above all, abhorring a war of races, we determined to wait until such time as an appeal to the good sense and justice of the American people could be made. The sober American judgment must obtain in the South as elsewhere in the Republic, that the only distinction upon which parties can be safely organized and in harmony with our institutions are differences of opinion relative to principles and policy of government, and that differences of religion nationality, or race can neither with safety nor propriety be permitted for a moment to enter into the party contests of the day. The unanimity with which the colored voters act with a party is not referable to any race prejudice on their pan. On the contrary, they invite the political cooperation of their white brethren, and vote as a unit because proscribed as such. They deprecate the establishment of the color line by the opposition, not only because the act is unwise and wrong in principle, but because it isolates them from the white men of the South, and forces them, in sheer self-protection and against their inclination, to act seemingly upon the basis of a race prejudice that they neither respect nor entertain. As a class they are free from prejudices, and have no uncharitable suspicions against their white fellow-citizens, whether native born or settlers from the Northern States. They not only recognize the equality of citizenship and the right of every man to hold, without proscription any position of honor and trust to which the confidence of the people may elevate him; but owing nothing to race, birth, or surroundings, they, above all other classes in the community, are interested to see prejudices drop out of both politics and the business of the country, and success in life proceed only upon the integrity and merit of the man who seeks it. . . . But withal, as they progress in intelligence and appreciation of the dignity of their prerogatives as citizens, they, as an evidence of growth begin to realize the significance of the proverb, “When thou doest well for thyself, men shall praise thee”; and are disposed to exact the same protection and concession of rights that are conferred upon other citizens by the Constitution, and that, too, without the humiliation involved in the enforced abandonment of their political convictions. I have confidence, not only in this country and her institutions, but in the endurance, capacity, and destiny of my people. We will, as opportunity offers and ability serves, seek our places, sometimes in the field of letters, arts, sciences, and the professions. More frequently mechanical pursuits will attract and elicit our efforts; more still of my people will find employment and livelihood as the cultivators of the soil. The bulk of this people-by surroundings, habits, adaptation, and choice-will continue to find their homes in the South, and constitute the masses of its yeomanry. We will there probably, of our own volition and more abundantly than in the past, produce the great staples that will contribute to the basis of foreign exchange, aid in giving the nation a balance of trade, and minister to the wants and comfort and build up the prosperity of the whole land. Whatever our ultimate position in the composite civilization of the Republic and whatever varying fortunes attend our career, we will not forget our instincts for freedom nor our love of country.",

        "summary": "Born in the early 20th century in Detroit, Michigan, Ralph Bunche became a world-renowned diplomat for the United Nations, winning the Nobel Peace Prize for brokering the 1949 Armistice Agreements in the Middle East. Known for his patience and optimism, he continued to negotiate peaceful settlements through his rise to the rank of under-secretary-general for the U.N., while also contributing to the civil rights struggle back home. Bunche died in 1971 in New York City. Ralph Johnson Bunche was born on August 7, 1904 (some sources say 1903), in Detroit, Michigan. After his family relocated to Albuquerque, New Mexico, Bunche's mother died during his early adolescence; reports vary on whether his father died soon after or abandoned the family. Bunche and his younger sister then relocated to Los Angeles and were taken in by his maternal grandmother, Lucy Taylor Johnson, who became a major advocate for the education of her grandson. Bunche attended Jefferson High School in Los Angeles, excelling in athletics before graduating as class valedictorian. He followed a similar path at the Southern Branch of the University of California, known today as UCLA, playing varsity sports and again graduating first in his class. He worked as a janitor to pay for additional expenses and also joined a ship's crew during summers, after being put to work upon being caught as a stowaway en route to a college military program. Enrolling at Harvard University, Bunche earned his M.A. in 1928 and his Ph.D. in governmental/international relations in 1934, thus becoming the first African American to earn a political science doctorate. Bunche also joined the faculty of Howard University in 1928, and he subsequently helped to launch its political science department. He later did postgraduate anthropological work at institutions like the London School of Economics and the University of Cape Town, and became co-director of Swarthmore College's Institute of Race Relations by the mid-1930s. Drawing from his personal experiences, Bunche penned the 1936 book A World View of Race. He also assisted journalist/sociologist Gunnar Myrdal in his research for An American Dilemma (1944), which looked unflinchingly at racial discrimination in the United States. Bunche served an important role in the founding of the United Nations. He was an adviser to the U.S. delegation at the 1945 San Francisco Conference, helping to draft Chapters XI and XII of the United Nations Charter. Bunche then joined the U.N. Secretariat in 1946 as director of the Trusteeship Division, giving him responsibility for overseeing the administration of the U.N. Trust Territories as they progressed toward self-government and independence. Bunche's work was continually informed by his belief in the power of negotiation and diplomacy over battle. Toward the end of the 1950s he had become U.N. under-secretary-general for special political affairs and had overseen the dispatch of thousands of non-fighting, neutral troops in the 1956 Suez conflict. Bunche cited this effort as 'the single most satisfying work' he'd ever done, as military forces were being used to maintain peace and not aid war. Bunche continued his service into the 1960s, orchestrating the cessation of conflict in the Congo (Zaire), Cyprus and Bahrain. He became the under-secretary-general of the U.N. in 1968, the highest post held by an American in the organization. Winning the Nobel Peace Prize In 1950, Bunche was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for negotiating the 1949 Armistice Agreements between Israel and four Arab states. He was the first African American and person of color to receive the award. Initially tasked in 1947 to assist mediator Count Folke Bernadotte of Sweden, Bunche took over talks on the island of Rhodes after Bernadotte was killed in a September 1948 terrorist attack. The long negotiation process was defined by the diplomat's willingness to meet with both sides and be meticulous, calm and patient about getting parties to sit with each other and find ways to compromise. Other Government Work In 1941, Bunche joined the Office of Strategic Services (OSS). He was later assigned a senior post in the U.S. State Department, before leaving to join the U.N.In 1949, U.S. President Harry Truman offered Bunche the position of assistant secretary of state, but the U.N. mediator turned him down, saying he did not want to subject his children to the segregationist policies that still ruled the nation's capital. Bunche also reportedly turned down an offer from President John Kennedy to become secretary of state. Prominently involved in social activism by the 1930s, Bunche was among the group of African-American intellectuals coined the 'Young Turks' by W.E.B. Du Bois. His integrationist beliefs were adopted by Martin Luther King Jr. and other civil rights leaders in the 1950s. Bunche later joined King for the 1963 March on Washington and the 1965 Selma to Montgomery Voting Rights March. He also served on the board of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People for more than two decades.",

He never knew either of his biological parents, but was raised by his former owners as if he were their own. A sickly child, his workload on the Carvers’ farm was reasonably light. Consequently, he spent much of his childhood wandering through fields and woods where he developed an affinity for the natural world. Faced with limited educational opportunities, he left Missouri for Kansas, where he graduated from high school. After a try at homesteading on the western plains of Kansas, he found his way to Iowa where he enrolled at the Iowa Agricultural College in Ames. Recruited by Booker T. Washington to head up Tuskegee’s Agricultural Department, Carver left the Midwest for Alabama’s cotton belt shortly after he became the first African American to secure an advanced degree in agricultural science. At Tuskegee, Carver launched a campaign aimed at lifting black farmers out of the desperate poverty in which most of them lived. Though his campaign ultimately failed in its aim, Carver adapted what he had learned in Ames in such a way as to put the application of its principles within reach of impoverished tenant farmers. In so doing, he anticipated the rise of organic farming and the push for the application of “appropriate technology.” As part of his larger efforts, Carver undertook research on numerous southern crops hoping to find a plant that could undermine cotton’s stranglehold on the region. For a variety of reasons, it was his work with peanuts that catapulted him into the national limelight in the early 1920s. As an icon—the Peanut Man—he was embraced by myriad groups for disparate, sometimes antithetical, reasons. Following his rise to fame, Carver sought to persuade southerners to find new uses for neglected natural resources and alternative ones for underutilized crops. His work with the latter made him a pioneer in the chemurgy movement, a movement that was eventually overwhelmed by the proliferation of petrochemical products. His deeply-held religious beliefs shaped his appreciation of the natural world, making him something of an environmental mystic, particularly in his later years.

Chisholm represented New York’s Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn and when initially elected, was assigned to the House Agriculture Committee, which she felt was irrelevant to her urban constituency. In an unheard-of move, she demanded reassignment and got switched to the Veterans Affairs Committee. By the time she left that chamber, she had held a place on the prized Rules and Education and Labor Committees. Chisholm was born in Brooklyn as the eldest of four daughters of parents who were immigrants from Barbados. She received her B.A. degree from Brooklyn College of the City University of New York in 1946 and she earned her M.A. degree from Columbia University in 1952 while working as a nursery school teacher, director of a child care center and later as an educational consultant with the city’s child care department. In 1964, she began her political career as a member of the New York State legislature as an assemblyperson. After four years there, she was elected on the Democratic ticket to serve in the U.S. Congress. She served two terms and in 1972 ran in the New York Democratic primary for president of the United States, establishing another first for black women. Chisholm recounted her campaign for the presidency in her book, Unbought and Unbossed. After leaving Congress, she was named to the Purington Chair at Mount Holyoke College in Massachusetts where she taught for four years. In 1985 she became a visiting scholar at Spelman College in Atlanta, Georgia. In the later years of her life, Chisholm became a sought-after speaker on the lecture circuit.",

        "summary": "In the late 1930s sociologist Kenneth B. Clark and his wife and collaborator, Mamie Phipps Clark, began to study the self-image of black children. The Clarks were among the first to describe the “harm and benefit” thesis in the area of civil rights and desegregation law. Attorney Thurgood Marshall and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) legal team used the Clark’s social science studies known as the “doll tests” in numerous legal challenges to the Jim Crow system of segregation. Kenneth Bancroft Clark was born to Miriam Hanson Clark and Arthur Bancroft Clark in the Panama Canal Zone, on July 24, 1914. The Clarks, originally from the West Indies, had come to the Canal Zone to work for one of the largest employers in the region, the United Fruit Company. Desperately wanting to give her children a chance for an education, Miriam separated from her husband and moved to Harlem, New York so that Kenneth and his younger sister Beulah could be educated in the United States. Arthur stayed behind believing that discrimination in the United States would hinder his obtaining a position comparable to his job at United Fruit. Kenneth Clark graduated from George Washington High School in 1931 and received bachelor and master degrees from Howard University in Washington, D.C. 1935 and 1936, respectively. Clark then enrolled at Columbia University and in 1940, became the first African American to earn the doctorate in psychology at the University. Clark taught at Hampton Institute (now Hampton University) from 1940 to 1941. A year later, he moved to the City College of New York, becoming the institution’s first permanent black faculty member. Kenneth Clark married Mamie Phipps, a high school teacher, in 1938. In 1946, the Clarks founded the North Side Center for child development which provided mental health and social services for children in Harlem. Clark also joined Sigma Pi Phi fraternity. In the 1940s and early 1950s the Clarks studied over 200 children from ages three to seven in what would be called doll studies. These studies showed that black children, when asked to choose a doll most like themselves, disproportionately choose the white dolls. The study also indicated that black children associated negative characteristics with black dolls and positive characteristics with the white dolls. Their work, replicated by other researchers, indicated that the isolation of black children in segregated schools generated psychological harm or damage. Kenneth Clark was enlisted by Thurgood Marshall and the NAACP legal team to provide testimony in three of the four cases leading to the decision by the U.S. Supreme Court in Brown v. Board of Education in 1954. Using Clark’s research, NAACP lawyers argued that racially separate educational facilities were psychologically harmful to African Americans and thereby violated the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. Over the next two decades Kenneth Clark published numerous books and articles in the field of social psychology. His books include Prejudice and Your Child (1963), The Dark Ghetto: Dilemmas of Social Power (1965), and Crisis in Education (1971). He was awarded numerous prizes including the NAACP’s Spingarn Medal in 1961. Kenneth Clark retired from teaching in 1975 and died in New York City on May 1, 2005 at the age of 90.",

Principally a self-trained historian, Clarke dedicated his life to correcting what he argued was the prevailing view that people of Africa and of African decent had no history worthy of study. Over the span of his career Clarke became one of the most respected historians of African and African American history. Clarke was born on New Year’s Day, 1915, in Union Springs, Alabama. He described his father as a “brooding, landless sharecropper,” who struggled to earn enough money to purchase his own farm, and his mother as a domestic. Clarke’s mother Willie Ella (Mays) Clarke died in 1922, when he was about seven years old. In 1932 Clarke left the South at age eighteen and he traveled by boxcar to Chicago, Illinois. He then migrated to New York City, New York where he came under the tutelage of noted scholar Arthur A. Schomburg. While in New York City’s Harlem, Clarke undertook the study of Africa, studying its history while working full time. In 1949 the New School for Social Research asked Clarke to teach courses in a newly created African Studies Center. Nineteen years later Clarke founded the African Heritage Studies Association in 1968, and was principally responsible for the creation of the Black and Puerto Rican Studies Department at Hunter College in New York City. He later lectured at Cornell University as a distinguished visiting Professor of African history. Clarke’s numerous works include A New Approach to African History (1967), African People in World History (1993), and The Boy Who Painted Jesus Black (1975). He died in New York City in 1998.",

        "summary": "John William Coltrane emerged as one of the most innovative and influential jazz musicians of the 20th century. Born in Hamlet, North Carolina on September 23, 1926, the son of John Robert and Alice Blair Coltrane, he grew up in High Point, North Carolina where his grandfather, Rev. William W. Blair, an African Methodist Episcopal (AME) minister, was one of the community leaders. John Coltrane’s childhood attendance at his family’s black church shaped the spiritual dimensions of his musical orientation. Following his father’s death and the family’s sudden impoverishment, he and his mother moved to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1943 to ensure he would have a proper education. Coltrane’s mother Alice worked as a domestic servant while nurturing her son’s musical interest and encouraged him to enroll at the Ornstein School of Music. Coltrane’s musical education was interrupted when he was drafted into the U.S. Navy at the end of World War II, where he played with a Hawaii-based naval band. By this point Coltrane found that he was increasingly attracted to jazz. After he left the Navy in 1945 he made his professional debut as an artist. Coltrane worked for a number of bandleaders including Dizzy Gillespie and Earl Bostic. As his reputation grew, John Coltrane began to work with the most famous jazz artists of the era. Between 1955 and 1959, he played in a band led by the legendary trumpeter Miles Davis. He also worked intermittently with the famed jazz pianist Thelonious Monk. In 1960 John Coltrane formed a group which eventually became known as the Classic Quartet and put into practice a unique compositional and improvisational technique he had developed based on “modal” playing. Coltrane quickly emerged as the leading jazz tenor saxophonist of the era. Described by some jazz critics as the “high priest” of avant-garde jazz, Coltrane’s style involved dense, rapidly changing chords with complex extensions built upon each note. Rejecting traditional harmonies, his quartet soon became a platform for introducing new ideas into jazz. John Coltrane’s innovative style was evident on his 1959 album Giant Steps, which remains a marker of musical excellence. Coltrane incorporated African musical traditions, slave spirituals and the blues into his compositions as well as elements of classical European and Indian musical traditions. Coltrane’s ability to draw inspiration from a variety of musical traditions was also evident on his albums India, Ascension, and especially A Love Supreme which was released in 1964 and soon became his most successful recording. By the late 1960s as the post-bebop era emerged, John Coltrane had gained status as the cultural saint of the Black Arts movement. A strong supporter of the civil rights movement, Coltrane’s song Alabama, written in response to the 1963 Birmingham church bombing that killed four little girls, symbolized the fusing of his musical, political and cultural consciousness and stood as a model for the emerging black power/ black consciousness movement of the period. Compositions such as Africa, Liberia, Dahomey Dance, Bakai, Dakar, and Afro Blue celebrated a new black aesthetic and freedom that expressly linked African America with Africa, thus celebrating the pan-Africanist transnational imagination. Coltrane was revered by a younger generation of revolutionary poets and writers who found comfort and inspiration in his music.",

        "summary": "William Henry Cosby, Jr., one of America’s most influential and successful entertainers, was born in Germantown, Pennsylvania on July 12, 1937 to William Henry, a U.S. Navy cook, and Anna Pearl Cosby, a maid. The family struggled financially, and moved into Philadelphia’s crime-ridden Richard Allen housing project which provided memorable material for Cosby’s later comedic career. Cosby became captain of his high school’s track and football teams and was accepted into a program for gifted students. Despite his academic and athletic potential, Cosby dropped out of school to join the U.S. Navy, serving four years and earning his high school equivalency in 1960. A year later, he was awarded a scholarship to Temple University in Philadelphia. To supplement his income, Cosby tended bar and gained a customer following with his wit. He eventually quit school in pursuit of a stand-up comedy career. During the next two years, he regularly performed at the popular Gas Light Café in New York City, New York’s Greenwich Village. At the age of 26, Cosby made his television debut on The Tonight Show, a career break coveted by aspiring comedians. In 1965, Cosby broke barriers when he became the first African American to star in a weekly dramatic television series with his role as a government agent on I Spy, an action-adventure series that ran for three seasons and earned him three Emmy awards. Cosby also starred in a number of films including Uptown Saturday Night(1974). During the 1970s, he made regular appearances on the educational children’s series The Electric Company and Sesame Street which led to his critically-acclaimed cartoon series, Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids (1972-1984) and influenced his return to college to earn a BA from Temple University (1970), and MA (1972) and Ed.D. (1976) degrees from the University of Massachusetts. Over the years, Cosby has donated millions of dollars to support educational opportunities for African Americans, including a 1988 donation of $20 million to Spelman College, the largest single gift to any HBCU. Cosby will be most remembered for The Cosby Show (1984-1992), which he created and starred in. The groundbreaking series which portrayed an intelligent, affluent, and successful African American family, ranks as one of the most popular series in American television history. In 1986, Cosby became a best-selling author with the publication of his book Fatherhood. He would go on to publish ten other books. Cosby’s role as a social critic was publicly debated in 2004 after he gave the controversial “Pound Cake” Speech at a National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) event commemorating the 50th Anniversary of the Brown v. Board of Education decision. In that speech he challenged the black community to become more accountable and responsible for the welfare of its children, evoking both praise and criticism from black activists for his honesty. Cosby and his wife Camille Hanks Cosby, married since 1964, are avid collectors of African American art. The couple maintain homes in New York, Massachusetts, and California. Their family endured tragedy in 1997 when the youngest of their five children, Ennis, was shot to death in Los Angeles, California while changing a flat tire on the freeway. After his death, the Cosbys established a foundation in their son’s name to support programs for students with learning disabilities. On April 26, 2018, a jury in Norristown, Pennsylvania, convicted Cosby on three counts of aggravated indecent assault against Andrea Constand, a former director of operations for Temple University’s women’s basketball team, who accused him of drugging and sexually assaulting her in his Elkins Park, Pennsylvania home in 2004. Constand is one of more than sixty women who have accused Cosby of rape, sexual assault, sexual misconduct, child sexual abuse, and battery. Cosby continues to deny the allegations, which span more than forty years beginning in the 1960s and continuing to the 2000s. Although the statute of limitations has expired in regards to criminal charges, many of the accusers are currently pursuing civil action against the actor. As a result of the allegations, numerous colleges and universities (including Spelman) and businesses have cut ties with Cosby, including those that had once awarded him honorary degrees or employed him as a spokesperson.",

He spent much of his life addressing the conditions of African Americans, urging an educated black elite to aspire to the highest intellectual attainments as a refutation of the theory of black inferiority. Crummell began his education at an integrated school in New Hampshire. He later transferred to an abolitionist institute in Whitesboro, New York, where he learned both the classics and manual labor skills. However, after being denied admittance to the General Theological Seminary of the Episcopal Church because of his race, Crummell was forced to study privately. Nonetheless, at the age of twenty-five, he became an Episcopalian minister. From 1848 to 1853, Crummell lectured and studied in England. He graduated from Queens’ College, Cambridge University in 1853. Crummell left England to become an educator in Liberia, accepting a faculty position at Liberia College in Monrovia. From his new post, Crummell urged African Americans to emigrate to Liberia. Internal politics, however, forced Crummell to leave Liberia in 1872, shattering his dream of the West African nation as a Christian republic populated by both indigenous people and African American immigrants. Crummell returned to the United States and settled in Washington, D.C. where he founded St. Luke’s Episcopal Church. When some Episcopal bishops proposed a segregated missionary district for black parishes, Crummell organized a group now known as the Union of Black Episcopalians to fight the proposal. Crummell also lectured widely across the United States, stressing the social responsibilities of educated middle class African Americans as race leaders. From 1895 to 1897, Crummell taught at Howard University in Washington, D.C. In 1897, the last year of his life, Crummell helped found the American Negro Academy and became its first president, with W.E.B. DuBois and William Saunders Scarborough as vice-presidents. Alexander Crummell, who would become a major influence on myriad black leaders including DuBois, Paul Lawrence Dunbar, and Marcus Garvey, died in Point Pleasant, New Jersey in 1898.",

The adopted son of Reverend Dr. Frederick A. Cullen, pastor of Salem Methodist Episcopal Church and president of the Harlem branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), and Carolyn Cullen, a classically trained musician and singer, Countee was raised in a racially-conscious, conservative, middle-class environment. He attended the prestigious DeWitt Clinton High School in Manhattan, where he edited the school newspaper and worked as the associate editor of the school’s literary magazine. He earned his bachelor of arts from New York University, graduating Phi Beta Kappa in 1925. Cullen received an M.A. in English at Harvard in 1926, after which he returned to New York to write and edit for the National Urban League’s magazine, Opportunity. Cullen’s talent as a poet was recognized at an early age. While both a high school student and an undergraduate, his poetry won several awards, and he consistently published in some of the leading magazines and journals, including Crisis and Harper’s. His first collection of poems, Color, was published in 1925, placing him squarely in the arts movement known as the Harlem Renaissance. Cullen’s conventional approach to poetry, both in form and subject matter, put him at odds with several of the younger writers of the Renaissance, including Langston Hughes and Wallace Thurman, although they all deeply respected one another. Cullen frowned upon Hughes’s experimentation with poetic form within a jazz idiom, and like some of the more conservative writers such as W.E.B. Du Bois and Jessie Fauset, he advocated for literature to represent the more respectable aspects of black life. Cullen went on to publish several collections of poems, an anthology of African American verse, a novel, and two children’s books. He arguably penned some of the most recognizable poems to African Americans, including “Heritage” and “Yet Do I Marvel.” Although there is very strong historical evidence that Cullen privately identified as a gay man, he never led an openly gay lifestyle. Rather, he married Du Bois’ daughter, Yolande, in 1929, but they divorced in 1930. He married Ida Roberson in 1940, by which time he was a teacher in the New York City public school system.

At as time when there were serious doubts that blacks had the mental capacity to fly airplanes, he later joined a small number of African Americans in the first flying training program for blacks at Tuskegee, Alabama. His pace setting achievements led him to command the famed 99th Pursuit Squadron and later the 332nd Fighter Group in World War II.

Delany was born in Charles Town, Virginia (now West Virginia) to a slave father and a free mother. Delany’s mother took her children to Pennsylvania in 1822 to avoid their enslavement and persecution brought on by attempting to teach her children to read and write, which was illegal in the state at that time. In 1833 Martin Delany began an apprenticeship with a Pittsburgh physician and soon opened a successful medical practice in cupping and leeching (it was not necessary to be certified to practice medicine prior to 1850). In 1843 he began publishing a newspaper in Pittsburgh called The Mystery, Later Delany joined Frederick Douglass to produce and promote The North Star in Rochester, New York. Martin R. Delany entered Harvard Medical School in 1850 to finish his formal medical education (along with two other black students) but was dismissed from the institution after only three weeks as a result of petitions to the school from white students. Two years later he published The Condition, Elevation, Emigration, and Destiny of the Colored People of the United States, Politically Considered, claiming that even abolitionists would never accept blacks as equals and thus the solution to the black condition lay in the emigration of all African Americans back to Africa. In 1859 Delany led an emigration commission to West Africa to explore possible sites for a new black nation along the Niger River, “We are a nation within a nation, we must go from our oppressors,” he wrote. When the Civil War began in 1861 Delany returned to the United States. Jettisoning for a time his emigrationist views, Delany recruited thousands of men for the Union Army. In February 1865, after meeting with President Abraham Lincoln to persuade the administration to create an all-black Corps led by African American officers, Delaney was commissioned a Major in the 52nd U.S. Colored Troops Regiment. With that appointment he became the first line officer in U.S. Army history. When Reconstruction began Delany was assigned to the Freedman’s Bureau in South Carolina. There he called for black pride, the enforcement of black civil rights and land for the freedpeople. Delany became active in local Republican politics, losing a close election for Lieutenant Governor of South Carolina but later serving briefly as a judge in Charleston, South Carolina. As the Republicans lost power in the state Delany renewed his calls for emigration, becoming in 1878 an official in the Liberian Exodus Joint Stock Steamship Company. He also wrote in 1879 The Principia of Ethnology, a book that argued for race pride and purity. In 1880 Delany withdrew from the Liberian Exodus Company and moved first to Boston, Massachusetts and then to Wilberforce College in Xenia, Ohio. Martin R. Delany, considered my many as the “father of black nationalism,” died in Xenia, Ohio on January 12, 1885.",

        "summary": "Frederick Douglass was born into Maryland slavery in 1817 to a slave mother and a slave master father. Young Douglass toiled on a rural plantation and later in Baltimore’s shipyards as a caulker. Douglass, however, learned to read and soon sought out abolitionist literature that alleviated what he termed the graveyard of his mind. He eventually escaped to New Bedford, Massachusetts in 1838, and took the surname Douglass, which he borrowed from the Scottish romance novel, Lady of the Lake by Sir Walter Scott. Douglass’s wife, Anna, followed with their five children. She worked as a laborer in a New Bedford shoe factory while Douglass became a world renowned anti-slavery orator. Douglass published his slave experiences in 1845 entitled Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, an American Slave: Written by Himself. Having publicly declared himself a fugitive slave, Douglass fled to the British Isles to continue his outspoken campaign against American slavery. After two years of lecturing in England, Scotland, and Ireland, Douglass’s freedom was purchased by abolitionist friends and he returned to the United States a free man. Upon his return in 1847, Douglass began his first newspaper, The North Star which later became Frederick Douglass’ Paper. Douglass’s life spanned important decades of American history in which the contradictions of race, class and gender were debated. Douglass played a crucial role in those debates. He spoke out against Northern race prejudice as well as Southern slavery. He challenged segregated Sabbaths–either white or black and criticized the race prejudice of immigrant labor organizations which excluded black freemen. Douglass once remarked that his son could more easily become an apprentice in a Boston law firm than in any workingman’s organization. Even while realizing this fact, Douglass became a strong advocate of industrial trade school education for the black workingman. In 1848 Douglass was the only male speaker at the Seneca Falls, New York convention in which Elizabeth Cady Stanton and other activists issued a “Declaration of Women’s Rights.” Douglass gave arguably his most famous oration, “What, to the Slave, Is the Fourth of July?” in Rochester, New York, on July 5, 1852. His theme was that American liberty was a fraud replete with thinly veiled crimes that would embarrass “a nation of savages.” As the United States rushed toward the Civil War, Douglass was forced to choose sides between African Americans who wanted to return to Africa and those who wanted to remain in the land of their birth. Beginning in the 1830s a series of national Negro conventions, held in various northern cities, debated whether to go or stay. Douglass advocated remaining and fighting to change the United States. During this period, Douglass was confronted by the black nationalist Henry Highland Garnett who in 1843 called on the slaves to rise up and strike for their freedom, and by Martin Delany in the 1850s who schemed with the American Colonization Society in support of emigration to Africa. However, with the passage of the Fugitive Slave Law in 1850, even Douglass began to entertain radical and violent solutions which would help blacks gain their freedom and, at the same time, destroy American slavery. His new radicalism led him to support John Brown’s raid by permitting Brown to stay at his home for planning strategy. With the outbreak of the Civil War, Douglass urged black men to support the war effort and specifically to join the Union Army with essays such as “Men of Color, To Arms.” Two of his sons were among those men who joined the all-black Fifty-fourth Massachusetts regiment. After the war, Douglass served as President of the Freedman’s Bank. He recognized the failure of Reconstruction in an 1888 speech entitled “I Denounce the So-Called Emancipation as a Stupendous Fraud.” In the remaining years of his life, Douglass served in a variety of federal positions which included America’s consul-general to Haiti (1889-1891), post he held simultaneously with the position of charge d’affaires to Santo Domingo (now the Dominican Republic). His activism continued even into the last few years of his life. Working with Ida B. Wells-Barnett, Douglass co-authored an indictment against the organizers of the 1892 Columbian Exposition held in Chicago in an essay entitled “Why the Colored American Is Not in the World’s Columbian Exposition.” Douglass died in Washington, D.C. in 1895. An essay written in 1857 captured his unrelenting zeal to fight against injustice when he said: “Those who profess to favor freedom, and yet deprecate agitation are men who want crops without plowing the ground, they want rain without thunder and lightning, they want the ocean without the awful roar of its many waters.",

        "summary": "Charles Richard Drew was an African American physician who developed ways to process and store blood plasma in blood banks. He directed the blood plasma programs of the United States and Great Britain in World War II, but resigned after a ruling that the blood of African Americans would be segregated. He died on April 1, 1950. A pioneering African American medical researcher, Dr. Charles R. Drew made some groundbreaking discoveries in the storage and processing of blood for transfusions. He also managed two of the largest blood banks during World War II. Drew grew up in Washington, D.C. as the oldest son of a carpet layer. In his youth, Drew showed great athletic talent. He won several medals for swimming in his elementary years, and later branched out to football, basketball and other sports. After graduating from Dunbar High School in 1922, Drew went to Amherst College on a sports scholarship. There, he distinguished himself on the track and football teams. Drew completed his bachelor's degree at Amherst in 1926, but didn't have enough money to pursue his dream of attending medical school. He worked as a biology instructor and a coach for Morgan College, now Morgan State University, in Baltimore for two years. In 1928, he At McGill University, Drew quickly proved to be a top student. He won a prize in neuroanatomy and was a member of the Alpha Omega Alpha, a medical honor society. Graduating in 1933, Drew was second in his class and earned both Doctor of Medicine and Master of Surgery degrees. He did his internship and residency at the Royal Victoria Hospital and the Montreal General Hospital. During this time, Drew studied with Dr. John Beattie, and they examined problems and issues regarding blood transfusions. After his father's death, Drew returned to the United States. He became an instructor at Howard University's medical school in 1935. The following year, he did a surgery residence at Freedmen's Hospital in Washington, D.C., in addition to his work at the university. Father of Blood Banks In 1938, Drew received a Rockefeller Fellowship to study at Columbia University and train at the Presbyterian Hospital in New York City. There, he continued his exploration of blood-related matters with John Scudder. Drew developed a method for processing and preserving blood plasma, or blood without cells. Plasma lasts much longer than whole blood, making it possible to be stored or banked for longer periods of time. He discovered that the plasma could be dried and then reconstituted when needed. His research served as the basis of his doctorate thesis, 'Banked Blood', and he received his doctorate degree in 1940. Drew became the first African American to earn this degree from Columbia. As World War II raged in Europe, Drew was asked to head up a special medical effort known as 'Blood for Britain.' He organized the collection and processing of blood plasma from several New York hospitals, and the shipments of these life-saving materials overseas to treat causalities in the war. According to one report, Drew helped collect roughly 14,500 pints of plasma. In 1941, Drew spearheaded another blood bank effort, this time for the American Red Cross. He worked on developing a blood bank to be used for U.S. military personnel. But not long into his tenure there, Drew became frustrated with the military's request for segregating the blood donated by African Americans. At first, the military did not want to use blood from African Americans, but they later said it could only be used for African American soldiers. Drew was outraged by this racist policy, and resigned his post after only a few months. After creating two of the first blood banks, Drew returned to Howard University in 1941. He served as a professor there, heading up the university's department of surgery. He also became the chief surgeon at Freedmen's Hospital. Later that year, he became the first African American examiner for the American Board of Surgery. In 1944, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People honored Drew with its 1943 Spingarn Medal for the highest and noblest achievement by an African-American during the preceding year or years. The award was given in recognition of Drew's blood plasma collection and distribution efforts. For the final years of his life, Drew remained an active and highly regarded medical professional. He continued to serve as the chief surgeon at Freedmen's Hospital and a professor at Howard University. On April 1, 1950, Drew and three other physicians attended a medical conference at the Tuskegee Institute in Alabama. Drew was behind the wheel when his vehicle crashed near Burlington, North Carolina. His passengers survived, but Drew succumbed to his injuries. He left behind his wife, Minnie, and their four children. Drew was only 45 years old at the time of his death, and it is remarkable how much he was able to accomplish in such a limited amount of time. As the Reverend Jerry Moore said at Drew's funeral, Drew had a life which crowds into a handful of years significance, so great, men will never be able to forget it. Since his passing, Drew has received countless posthumous honors. He was featured in the United States Postal Service's Great Americans stamp series in 1981, and his name appears on educational institutions across the country.",

        "summary": "W.E.B. Du Bois, or William Edward Burghardt Du Bois, was an African American writer, teacher, sociologist and activist whose work transformed the way that the lives of black citizens were seen in American society. Considered ahead of his time, Du Bois was an early champion of using data to solve social issues for the black community, and his writing—including his groundbreaking The Souls of Black Folk—became required reading in African American studies. Born in Great Barrington, Massachusetts, on February 23, 1868, Du Bois’ birth certificate has his name as “William E. Duboise.” Two years after his birth his father, Alfred Du Bois, left his mother, Mary Silvina Burghardt. Du Bois became the first person in his extended family to attend high school, and did so at his mother’s insistence. In 1883, Du Bois began to write articles for papers like the New York Globe and the Freeman. Du Bois initially attended Fisk University in Nashville, Tennessee, a school for black students. His tuition was paid by several churches in Great Barrington. Du Bois became an editor for the Herald, the student magazine. After graduation, Du Bois attended Harvard University, starting in 1888 and eventually receiving advanced degrees in history. In 1892, Du Bois worked towards a Ph.D. at the University of Berlin until his funding ran out. He returned to the United States without his doctorate but later received one from Harvard while teaching classics at Wilberforce University in Ohio. There, he married Nina Gomer, one of his students, in 1896. His doctoral thesis, “The Suppression of the African Slave Trade to the United States of America, 1638–1870,” became his first book and a standard in American education covering slavery. Du Bois took a position at the University of Pennsylvania in 1896 conducting a study of the city’s Seventh Ward, published in 1899 as The Philadelphia Negro. The work took up so much of his time that he missed the birth of his first son in Great Barrington. The study is considered one of the earliest examples of statistical work being used for sociological purposes, with extensive fieldwork resulting in hundreds of interviews conducted door-to-door by Du Bois. Mapping out the Seventh Ward and carefully documenting familial and work structures, Du Bois concluded that the black community’s greatest challenges were poverty, crime, lack of education and distrust of those outside the community. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics offered Du Bois a job in 1897, leading to several groundbreaking studies on black Southern households in Farmville, Virginia, that uncovered how slavery still affected the personal lives of African Americans. Du Bois would do four more studies for the bureau, two in Alabama and two in Georgia. These studies were considered radical at the time when sociology existed in pure theoretical forms. Du Bois was pivotal in making investigation and data analysis crucial to sociological study. During the same period, Du Bois wrote “The Strivings of the Negro People” for the Atlantic Monthly, a groundbreaking essay that explained to white readers how it feels to be a victim of racism. It is considered the general public’s introduction to Du Bois. Du Bois and family moved to Atlanta University, where he taught sociology and worked on his additional Bureau of Labor Statistics studies. Among the books written during this period was The Souls of Black Folk, a collection of sociological essays examining the black experience in America. Partially derived from his Atlantic article, it embraced Du Bois’ personal history in his arguments. The book also introduced the idea of “double consciousness,” in which African Americans are required to consider not only their view of themselves but also the view that the world, particularly whites, has on them during all parts of life. It also expressly differentiated Du Bois from more conservative black voices like Booker T. Washington. In 1899, Du Bois’ son Burghardt contracted diphtheria and died after Du Bois spent the night looking for one of three black doctors in Atlanta, since no white doctor would treat the child. A resulting essay, “The Passing of the First Born,” appeared in The Souls of Black Folk. The Niagara Movement And Booker T. Washington In 1903, Du Bois taught summer school at Booker T. Washington’s Tuskegee University, but friction between the two men led to Du Bois joining Washington’s rivals in the Niagara Movement, charged with seeking justice and equality for African Americans. That group failed, partly due to opposition from Washington, but during its existence Du Bois published The Moon Illustrated Weekly, the first weekly magazine for African Americans, producing a total of 34 issues before folding in 1906. He followed this up briefly with the journal Horizon. In 1910, Du Bois accepted the directorship of the recently-formed NAACP. He moved to New York City and served as the editor of the organization’s monthly magazine The Crisis. The magazine was a huge success and became very influential, covering race relations and black culture with Du Bois’ forthright style. The magazine stood out for its continual endorsement and coverage of women’s suffrage. Du Bois worked for the NAACP for 24 years, during which time he published his first novel, The Quest of the Silver Fleece. After a brief second stint at Atlanta University, Du Bois returned to the NAACP as director of special research in 1944 and represented the organization at the first meeting of the United Nations. Du Bois also became more interested in communism and international issues, and became an open supporter of progressive and left-wing groups, which created problems with NAACP leadership. He left the organization again in 1948. Du Bois’ radicalism continued in the public sphere, running as the Progressive Party’s candidate for Senate in 1950 and losing. He and other members of the Peace Information Center were charged as agents of a foreign principal, inspired by the organization’s Soviet leanings, but were acquitted in a trial in 1951. Following the death of his wife in 1950, Du Bois married Shirley Graham the following year. Graham’s interest led Du Bois further into exploring communism, delving into the American Communist community and becoming known for his apologetic view of Joseph Stalin. In 1961 Du Bois officially joined the American Communist Party before leaving the country to live in Ghana at the invitation of its president and becoming a citizen there. Du Bois first conceived of the Encyclopedia Africana in 1908 as a compendium of history and achievement of people of African descent designed to bring a sense of unity to the African diaspora. Unable to raise the needed funds, Du Bois wasn’t able to revisit the project until 1935, but it was disrupted by professional battles. Du Bois published some entries from the proposed encyclopedia and even editions of research material, but it wasn’t until 1962 that a further promise was made to complete the encyclopedia. After Du Bois was invited to move to Ghana, he pledged to finally publish the work, but it was never realized before his death. Du Bois died on August 27, 1963 in Ghana and was given a state funeral.",

His father, Joshua Dunbar, was an escaped slave who joined the 55th Massachusetts Regiment of the Union Army and served in the Civil War. Joshua married Matilda Murphy, a laundress who moved to Dayton following the war. Dunbar’s parents separated before he was two years old and he lived with his mother, who sparked his interest in literature. By the age of six, he was writing and reciting poetry. He went on to attend Dayton Central High, where he excelled as a member of the debating society, president of the literary society, editor of the school newspaper, and class poet. In 1892 that he gave his first recital at the annual Western Association of Writers meeting in Dayton. The notoriety he received from this event led to a prodigious, yet short-lived career, as a literary artist – as Dunbar authored several novels, books, librettos, songs, essays, short stories, and six volumes of poetry beginning with Oak and Ivy (1893). Financial difficulties would, however, force him to work as an elevator operator for supplementary income. Primarily recognized as a poet, Dunbar’s poetry was written in two distinct styles: traditional English and turn of the twentieth century black American dialect. His publications Majors and Minors (1895) and Lyrics of a Lowly Life (1897) both won Dunbar national fame and invitations to recite his poetry publicly. His most famous recitals took place at the 1893 World Columbia Exposition in Chicago and in England, where he toured for six months in 1897. In 1898, he married Alice Ruth Moore, an author and educator whom he fell in love with after seeing a photograph of Nelson next to a poem she published in the Boston Monthly Review. Yet Dunbar’s abuse toward Moore (aggravated by his battle with alcoholism prescribed for tuberculosis) resulted in mutual separation in 1902. Dunbar moved into the home he shared with his mother in Dayton, Ohio.

His compositions, and the travels of his band, exposed the world to jazz and earned him the nickname, “The Ambassador of Jazz.” Edward Kennedy Ellington was born in Washington, D.C. in 1899 to Daisy and James Ellington. Ellington’s parents appreciated good manners, dress, food, and a love of music (both played piano, though neither could read music) and diligently passed these characteristics on to their son. This “duked up” appearance earned him the nickname “Duke” growing up, and it stuck for the rest of his life. Starting with piano lessons at age six, and continuing with private lessons from local bar players, Duke developed a love and talent for ragtime music. In 1917 Ellington formed his first band, “Duke’s Serenaders,” which played dance halls throughout the Washington, D.C. area. The band became so popular that in 1923 Ellington moved it to New York and renamed it ‘The Washingtonians.” Ellington arrived in New York just when jazz emerged as the dominant musical style of the Harlem Renaissance. Jazz was a much more complex, improvisational genre than ragtime. Ellington, sensing the change in musical styles and tastes, attracted to the Washingtonians some of the greatest jazz musicians in the country including “Bubber” Miley, “Trick Sam” Nanton, Harry Carney, and Johnny Hodges. He also wrote music that fit each player’s style. By 1927 the Washingtonians played regularly at prominent Harlem nightspots including the Club Kentucky, the Exclusive Club, the Plantation Club, and most importantly, the Cotton Club. The Cotton Club engagement led to the band’s weekly radio program bringing Duke Ellington’s sound to the entire country. In 1931 Ellington’s all-African American band hit the road playing jazz shows across the United States and Europe while recording albums and appearing in movies. Teaming with Billy Strayhorn, Ellington composed some of the greatest pieces in jazz music, and unlike the customs of the time, formally wrote his music down. Among his hits were “East St. Louis Toodle-Oo,” “Mood Indigo,” “Rocking in Rhythm,” “Black, Brown and Beige,” “Solitude,” “The Mooche,” and “Take the A-Train.” Ellington tried unsuccessfully to write different versions of jazz later in his life that fit classical and religious molds. His efforts brought him recognition and respect from some of the best known classical composers in the world. In 1943 Ellington’s band played Carnegie Hall in New York City. Thirteen years later his performance at the 1956 Newport Jazz festival in Rhode Island put his face on the cover of Time magazine. In 1969 on his seventieth birthday, “Duke” Ellington was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Richard Nixon. By the time of his death in 1974, Edward Kennedy “Duke” Ellington was considered one of the greatest composers in the United States and one of the key figures in the growth and sustained success of jazz.",

        "summary": "James Forten was born free on September 2, 1766 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. His parents were Thomas and Sarah Forten. He was also the grandson of slaves. His formative years were spent in Philadelphia, and he attended Anthony Benezet’s Quaker school for African American children. By the time he turned eight years old, he was working for Robert Bridges’s sail loft. This is where his father worked as well. The following year, his father was the victim of an unfortunate boating accident and died. This tragedy resulted in nine-year-old James having to take on additional work to support his family. Over time, James Forten became interested in politics and avidly campaigned for and supported temperance, women’s suffrage, and equal rights for African Americans. In 1800, he was the leader in organizing a petition that called for Congress to emancipate all slaves. Given the fact that this was a presidential election year, rumor had it that a few of the presidential candidates (among them Thomas Jefferson) were none too pleased with a black man advocating for the emancipation of slaves. His activism was further recognized when he wrote and published a pamphlet denouncing the Pennsylvania legislature for prohibiting the immigration of freed black slaves from other states. During his early teens, he worked as a powder boy during the Revolutionary War on the Royal Lewis sailing ship. After being captured by the British army, he was released and returned home to resume his previous job. Pleased with his work and dedication, he was appointed to the foreman’s position in the loft. By 1798, Bridges decided to retire and wanted Forten to remain in charge of the loft. Eventually James Forten owned the business and employed almost forty workers. In 1817, Forten joined with Richard Allen, the founder of the African Methodist Episcopal Church, to form the Convention of Color. Interestingly, the organization argued for the migration of free black slaves to Canada, but vehemently resisted any movement for a return to the African continent. Other prominent men who joined Forten and Allen were William Wells Brown, Samuel Eli Cornish, and Henry Highland Garnet. James Forten died on March 4, 1842. His early years had been devoted to providing for his widowed mother, his middle years towards acquiring a vast economic fortune and rectifying the brutal injustices that had been perpetrated upon his fellow African Americans, poor people, and women.",

        "summary": "John Hope Franklin, one of the nation’s leading historians, is the only African American who has served as president of both the American Historical Association (AHA) and the Organization of American Historians (OAH). Franklin was born in Rentiesville, Oklahoma on January 2, 1915 to parents Buck, a Tulsa attorney, and Mollie Franklin. He recalled growing up in Tulsa, in a Jim Crow society that stifled his senses and damaged his “emotional health and social well being.” While his family was in Rentiesville, Buck Franklin not only survived the June 1921 Tulsa Race Riot, but also successfully sued the city. This suit, before the Oklahoma Supreme Court, overturned a Tulsa ordinance which prevented the city’s blacks from rebuilding their destroyed community. Franklin attended Fisk University in Nashville, Tennessee, graduating magna cum laude in 1935. He received his M.A. in history from Harvard in 1936, taught at Fisk University and returned to Harvard to complete the Ph.D. in history in 1941. While matriculating at Harvard, he took on a teaching position at St. Augustine’s College, a predominantly black college, in Raleigh, North Carolina. This position enabled him to complete his research for his dissertation which was published in 1943 as The Free Negro in North Carolina, 1790-1860. This book established his importance to southern history and he was subsequently invited, in 1949, to present a paper at the Southern Historical Association which broke the color line for that association. In 1956, Franklin became the first black person hired as chairman of a history department. That position at Brooklyn College led, in 1964, to an endowed chair at the University of Chicago (Illinois) in 1967 where he also served as department chair until 1970. Franklin remained on the University of Chicago until 1982 when he accepted the James B. Duke Professorship at Duke University. John Hope Franklin’s most important work was the 1947 publication of From Slavery to Freedom: A History of Negro Americans which has become the longest, continuously published survey text used in American history courses. Franklin has published a number of other books including The Militant South (1956); Reconstruction After the Civil War (1961); Color and Race (1968); A Southern Odyssey: Travelers in the Antebellum North (1975); and George Washington Williams: A Biography (1985). In 1979 President Jimmy Carter appointed Franking to the Advisory Commission on Public Diplomacy and in 1980 he was a United States delegate to the 21st General Conference of UNESCO. He has also taught in England, Australia, and the People’s Republic of China. He serves on the advisory board and is the former chair of One America: The President’s Initiative on Race created by President Bill Clinton in 1997. John Hope Franklin, a member of Alpha Phi Alpha and Sigma Pi Phi fraternities, died in Durham, North Carolina on March 25, 2009 at the age of 94.",

        "summary": "Born into slavery near New Markey, Maryland on December 23, 1815, Henry Highland Garnet escaped from bondage via the Underground Railroad with his parents, George and Henrietta Trusty in 1824. After residing briefly in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, the family settled in New York City, New York where George Trusty changed the family name to Garnet. George Garnet found work as a shoemaker and joined the Methodist Episcopal Church. The Garnets lived among other working class families in what would later be called the Lower East Side. Henry’s childhood was a mix of opportunities and difficulties. He attended the African Free School, which was one of several schools established in northeastern cities by white philanthropists. His classmates included several future black abolitionist leaders such as Alexander Crummell, Samuel Ringgold Ward, and James McCune Smith. Like all free blacks during the antebellum era, the Garnets were always in danger of capture by slave catchers. While Henry Garnet was at sea working as a cabin boy and cook, his parents narrowly escaped slave catchers, who destroyed or stole the furniture from their home. After he returned home, Garnet then suffered a debilitating leg injury that plagued him for the rest of his life. He found solace and inspiration in the church and joined the First Colored Presbyterian Church in New York where he also found a community of abolitionists. Henry Highland Garnet married Julia Ward Williams, a teacher, in 1841. The family moved frequently as Garnet pursued the ministry and teaching as well as abolitionist activities. In 1843 Garnet became nationally prominent when he delivered an address at the National Negro Convention meeting in Buffalo. He urged the slaves to rebel and claim their own freedom. In 1864 Garnett became pastor of the Fifteenth Street Presbyterian Church in Washington, D.C. On Sunday, February 12, 1865 Garnet preached a sermon in the U.S. House of Representatives. Although he did not address Congress, his presentation was the first by an African American in the Capitol Building. In 1868 Garnet moved to Pittsburgh where he briefly served as President of Avery College, a school of religious education for African Americans. Originally an opponent of the colonization movement, by the mid-nineteenth century Garnet shifted his support to the migration of black Americans to Liberia. In December 1881 President James A. Garfield appointed Garnet minister (ambassador) to Liberia. Garnet moved to the West African nation but died on February 13, 1882, barely two months after his arrival.",

        "occupation": "Activist",
        "summary": "Marcus Mosiah Garvey, one of the most influential 20th Century black nationalist and Pan-Africanist leaders, was born on August 17, 1887 in St. Ann’s Bay, Jamaica. Greatly influenced by Booker T. Washington’s autobiography Up From Slavery, Garvey began to support industrial education, economic separatism, and social segregation as strategies that would enable the assent of the “black race.” In 1914, Garvey established the Universal Negro Improvement Association (UNIA) in Kingston, Jamaica, adopting Washington’s inspirational phrase “Up, you mighty race; you can conquer what you will.” By May of 1917, Garvey relocated the UNIA in Harlem and began to use speeches and his newspaper, The Negro World, to spread his message across the United States to an increasingly receptive African American community. His major audience included the thousands of Southern blacks who were then migrating from the “shadow of slavery and the plantation” to the urban North. Black veterans of World War I were another Garvey audience. Most of them had experienced both French equality and US military bigotry and returned home as militant “race men.” They were attracted to Garvey’s calls. The UNIA grew larger still following the race riots in the Red Summer of 1919. Garveyism resonated with the rapidly urbanizing black community and spread beyond the United States to the Caribbean, Latin America and Africa. Regardless of the locale, Garvey’s UNIA promised black economic uplift via self-reliance, political equality via self-determination, and the “liberation of Africa from European colonialism via a Black army marching under the Red, Black, and Green flag of Black manhood.” Africa’s redemption, according to UNIA supporters was foretold in the messianic Biblical Psalms 68:31 “Princes shall come out of Egypt; Ethiopia shall soon stretch out her hands unto God.” However, it was Garvey’s ability to convey, in his vivid and powerful speeches, the distinct possibility of achieving these goals that led the UNIA to become an organization of millions. When Garvey bellowed, “I am the equal of any white man [and] I want you to feel the same way,” he inspired the faithful and attracted the curious. Addressing the gender question Garvey wrote, “Black queen of beauty, thou hast given color to the world…Black men worship at thy virginal shrine of purest love…!” Garvey even created a new black faith by ordaining Reverend George Alexander McGuire as Chaplain General of the African Orthodox Church. McGuire’s sermons urged Garveyites to “Erase the white gods from your hearts.” At the 1920 UNIA International Convention at Madison Square Garden, with twenty five thousand delegates and observers in attendance, Garvey issued the Declaration of Rights of the Negro Peoples of the World. The convention also produced the Universal Ethiopian Anthem. The Negro World, the official newspaper of the UNIA, also spread the organization’s philosophy globally. With a circulation of over 200,000 and published in three languages, Spanish and French as well as English, the Negro World was read on four continents. Garvey’s most ambitious effort was the establishment of the Black Star Steamship Line. Garvey hoped that this joint stock corporation would develop lucrative commercial networks between the United States, the Caribbean, and the continent of Africa. He also hoped that his three ships would help in the return of millions of blacks in the “Diaspora” to Mother Africa. However, because of heavy debt and mismanagement, the steamship line went bankrupt and Garvey in January 1922 was arrested and charged with using the US Mail to defraud stock investors. Ultimately, Garvey garnered the wrath of African American leaders when he met with the Ku Klux Klan leader, Edward Young Clark in Richmond, Virginia in June 1922. Garvey naively believed the two organizations could work together since they both supported the goal of racial purity. Clark in fact did promise some financial assistance for the UNIA. After hearing of this meeting, however, the NAACP leader, W.E.B. DuBois, called Garvey the greatest enemy of the Negro race. The Urban League called Garvey a “swindler” and black union leader A. Philip Randolph said that Garvey and Garveyism should be purged from American soil. Various civil rights organizations now mounted a coordinated “Garvey Must Go” campaign. The Justice Department, seeking to discredit Garvey because it felt he represented a threat to colonial interest and menaced racial peace in the US, hired its first black agent, James Wormley Jones, to infiltrate the UNIA. Garvey was convicted of mail fraud in 1923 and sentenced to five years in federal prison. In part, because of a letter writing campaign orchestrated by Garvey’s second wife, Amy Jacques Garvey, President Calvin Coolidge commuted his sentence in 1927 in exchange for the UNIA President accepting deportation. Garvey spent his last years in Jamaica trying to revive his political fortunes and eventually died in London, England in 1940, never having set foot on African soil.",

There were several Prince Halls in Boston at this time. He is believed to have been the slave of a Boston leather worker who was granted freedom in 1770 after twenty-one years of service. He then opened a successful leather goods store, owned his house, was a taxpayer, and a voter. Hall supplied the Boston Regiment with leather goods and may have fought in the Battle of Bunker Hill. In 1775, fifteen free blacks, including Hall, joined a freemason lodge of British soldiers. They formed their own lodge, African Lodge #1, when the British left. However, they were not granted full stature by the Grand Lodge of England until 1784. The actual charter arrived in 1787, at which time Hall became the Worshipful Master. Even though they had full stature, most white freemason lodges in America did not treat them equally. Hall helped other black Masonic lodges form. Upon his death in 1807, they became the Prince Hall Grand Lodges. There are 46 lodges across the United States today. Hall used his leadership position to organize black activism. In 1787, Hall unsuccessfully petitioned the Massachusetts legislature to send blacks back to Africa where they could be fully free and also serve as a trading partner. Later that year, Hall’s petition for black public school funding was denied. But in 1796, Boston approved his request to fund black schools, but they said they did not have a building, so Hall let the school operate from his home. Hall helped Massachusetts pass legislation outlawing the slave trade and punishing those involved with it (1788). Hall continued to work for abolition, equal rights, and economic advancement in the black society until his death.",

        "occupation": "Civil rights activist",
        "summary": "Fannie Lou Hamer was a grass-roots civil rights activist whose life exemplified resistance in rural Mississippi to oppressive conditions. Born on October 6, 1917 in Montgomery County, Mississippi, to a family of sharecroppers, she was the youngest of Lou Ella and Jim Townsend’s twenty children. Her family moved to Sunflower County, Mississippi in 1919 to work on the E. W. Brandon plantation. Hamer’s activism began in the 1950s when she attended several annual conferences of the Regional Council of Negro Leadership organized by Dr. T.R.M. Howard, a wealthy businessman and civil rights leader in the all-black town of Mound Bayou, Mississippi. There, Hamer encountered prominent civil rights leaders such as Thurgood Marshall of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) and Michigan Congressman Charles Diggs. Several pivotal moments in Hamer’s life became public reminders that America’s vision of democracy was incongruent with its horrifying reality. In 1961 she was sterilized without her knowledge or consent by a white doctor as part of the state of Mississippi’s plan to reduce the number of impoverished blacks in the state. On August 23, 1962, after hearing a sermon by Rev. James Bevel, she volunteered to become an organizer for the Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) to help black Mississippians register to vote. While she was traveling by bus on June 3, 1963, state law enforcement officers in Winona, Mississippi, took Hamer and fellow activists to Montgomery County Jail where they were beaten mercilessly. She testified that she was beaten until her “body was hard.” She suffered a blood clot, sustained damage to her kidney, and required a month to recover from the assault. Hamer was not intimidated and after her recovery returned to the effort to register and organize black voters. In 1964, Hamer became one of the statewide leaders in the Freedom Summer Campaign which brought hundreds of volunteers from across the nation to Mississippi to help with voter registration. It was during that summer campaign that three civil rights workers, James Chaney, Michael Schwerner, and Andrew Goodman, were killed by anti-black terrorists. Hamer became a national figure during the summer as the co-founded the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party (MFDP). The Democratic Party in Mississippi barred black participation. As a consequence black and white activists in the state created the MFDP. Since 1964 was a Presidential election year, and the regular Democrats had threatened to withhold support to the national Democratic ticket, Hamer and other MFDP leaders traveled to the National Democratic National Convention in Atlantic City, New Jersey to argue that they should be the official delegation from Mississippi to the convention. Hamer, vice president of MFDP, spoke before the Credentials Committee protesting the all-white delegation from Mississippi. Although President Lyndon Johnson gave an emergency presidential press conference to prevent her testimony from going live over the three television networks, her speech was later aired across the country. In stirring testimony she described the oppressive conditions she and other black Mississippians faced on a daily basis and urged recognition of the MFDP to encourage blacks to register to vote. Senator Hubert Humphrey who was campaigning for the vice presidential nomination, led a group of high level Democratic Party activists to persuade Hamer and the MFDP to accept a compromise that would allow token (non-voting) representation in the regular Mississippi Democratic delegation. Hamer and the MFDP rejected the compromise and returned to Mississippi. Her campaign, however, led to significant reforms in the way delegates are selected for the national Democratic Party conventions. Beginning in 1968, the Democratic Party required equality of representation in state delegations. Hamer continued to work in Mississippi for voting rights. She ran unsuccessfully for Congress in 1964 and in a special election in 1965. In 1968, she was part of the regular Mississippi delegation to the National Democratic Party Convention where she was an outspoken critic of the Vietnam War. Hamer was also inducted as an honorary member of Delta Sigma Theta Sorority. On March 14, 1977, Fannie Lou Hamer died of cancer at age 59 in Ruleville, Mississippi. She was buried at Freedom Farms Cooperative, an organization she helped to establish so that poor farmers would have an opportunity to purchase their own land. Her epitaph reads: “I’m sick and tired of being sick and tired.”",

Born in Richmond, Virginia, to parents James Height, a building contractor, and Fannie (Burroughs) Height, a nurse, she moved with her family to Rankin, a town near Pittsburgh in Pennsylvania, at the age of four. A severe asthmatic as a child, she was not expected to live to the age of 16. Always a diligent and dedicated student, Height won an Elks sponsored $1,000 scholarship in a national oratorical contest, which she used to attend New York University. Height earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Education, and a Masters in Educational Psychology from New York University in four years. Height’s first job was as a caseworker in the New York City Welfare Department. In 1937, Height met Mary McLeod Bethune, founder and president of the National Council of Negro Women (NCNW). Bethune became Height’s mentor and the two worked closely together until Bethune’s death in 1955. Two years later Height became the fourth President of the National Council of Negro Women, a post she would hold until 1998. Height also served as National President of Delta Sigma Theta Sorority from 1946 to 1957. In 1952 Height served as visiting professor in the School of Social Work at the University of Delhi, India. Height led the NCNW during the civil rights era of the 1950s and 1960s. As president, Height helped organize The March on Washington in 1963. She worked with every major civil rights leader of the period including Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., Roy Wilkins, Whitney Young, and A. Philip Randolph. During the 1960s Height coordinated “Wednesdays in Mississippi,” where both black and white women throughout the nation met to discuss racial justice issues. She also personally encouraged President Dwight Eisenhower to desegregate public schools, and urged President Lyndon B. Johnson to appoint black women into governmental positions. Dorothy Height was equally well known for her leadership with the Young Women’s Christian Association (YWCA). She first became a staff member in Harlem in 1944. By 1946 she was elected the National Interracial Education Secretary for the YWCA where she led the effort to integrate all of the facilities of the agency. In 1965 Height became the first director of the YWCA’s Center for Racial Justice, a position she held until her retirement from the organization in 1977. In 1971 she joined Gloria Steinem, Shirley Chisholm, Betty Fredian and others to found the National Women’s Political Caucus. In 1986, Height organized the first Black Family Reunion Celebration designed to reinforce the strengths and traditions of the African American family. Over the next two decades the events related to this celebration would attract over 12 million people. Over the course of her lifetime, Dr. Height became well respected across the nation for her leadership in the campaign for women’s employment, education, and equal pay. She is best known, however, for her efforts on behalf of racial equality. Her awards stretch over half a century. In 1944, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt honored Height with the Freedom from Want Award. In 1989 President Ronald Reagan awarded Height with the Citizens’ Medal Award for distinguished service.

Henson was born on a farm in Nanjemoy, Maryland on August 8, 1866. His parents were free people of color who worked as sharecroppers. Both parents died when Henson was a child and he was subsequently sent to Washington, D.C. to live with an uncle. At the age of 12, after his uncle’s death, Henson moved to Baltimore where he became a cabin boy on a merchant ship, the Katie Hines. The captain of the vessel taught Henson to read and write. Henson sailed the world with the Katie Hines for the next few years. By the age of 20 he had visited China, Japan, the Philippines, France, Africa, and Russia. By November 1887, however, Henson worked at a Washington D.C. clothing store where he met Commander Robert E. Peary. Impressed by Henson’s experience, Peary hired him to go on a surveying expedition to Nicaragua to determine if a canal could be built across the country from the Atlantic to the Pacific. Peary called him his “first man” in seven expeditions he led to the Arctic region for the next two decades. Over that time, Henson traded with the Inuit in Canada and Greenland and learned their language. Eventually, both he and Peary married Inuit women. The most important of Peary’s expeditions took place in 1908-09 when Peary led his eighth attempt to reach the North Pole. On August 18, 1909, Peary and Henson left Greenland by ship to begin their effort to reach the Pole. They were accompanied by 22 Inuit men and 17 Inuit women, 10 children, 246 dogs and 70 tons of whale meat from Labrador, Canada. Peary and Henson left their ship at Ellesmere Island in what is now Nunavut Territory, Canada and with a smaller party of four Inuit men, laid a trail of supplies to the Pole. Peary became ill on the expedition and sent Henson ahead as a scout. Henson proceeded to place the American flag at what he thought was the North Pole. In 1912, Henson wrote A Negro Explorer at the North Pole, a book that details his experiences on his journey, and in 1913, he was appointed clerk in the U.S. Customs House in New York City, New York by President Taft. Henson retired in 1936, and in 1944 he was awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor given to all of the members of the 1909 expedition. In 1947, Henson collaborated with Bradley Robinson on Dark Companion, Robinson’s biography of Henson. The explorer died in New York City in 1955 at the age of 89 and was buried in the city. In 1988, Henson was re-interred in Arlington National Cemetery near Peary’s monument. Many members from his American family and his Inuit family (children he produced with his Inuit “wife” Anauakaq) were in attendance. In 1996, the U.S. Navy commissioned the U.S.N.S. Henson, a T-AGS 63 class oceanographic explorer ship, in honor of Matthew Henson. In 2000, the National Geographic Society awarded the Hubbard Medal to Matthew A. Henson posthumously.",

        "summary": "Charles Hamilton Houston, a renowned civil rights attorney, is widely recognized as the architect of the civil rights strategy that led to the U.S. Supreme Court’s 1954 decision, Brown v. Board of Education. He was also a mentor to Thurgood Marshall who successfully litigated the pivotal Brown case. Houston was born on September 3, 1895, in Washington, DC to parents William Houston, an attorney, and Mary Houston, a hairdresser and seamstress. He attended M Street High School (later Dunbar High School) in Washington, DC. Following graduation, he enrolled at Amherst College in Massachusetts, where he was the only black student in his class. Houston was elected to Phi Beta Kappa, the national honor society. Upon graduating in 1915, he was selected to deliver that year’s valedictory address. After graduating from Amherst, Houston returned to Washington. He joined the U.S. Army in 1917 and trained at the all-black officers’ training camp at Fort Des Moines, Iowa in 1917. Houston was later deployed to France. While there, Houston and his fellow black soldiers experienced racial discrimination, which deepened his resolve to study law. Following his military discharge in 1919, Houston entered Harvard Law School. He excelled in his studies and became the first black editor of the Harvard Law Review. As a law student, Houston was mentored by future Supreme Court Judge Felix Frankfurter. In 1922, as Houston graduated with high honors, Frankfurter nominated him for the prestigious Frederick Sheldon Fellowship, which allowed him to study law at the University of Madrid. Upon his return from Spain in 1924, Houston practiced law with his father, William, at Houston & Houston, and began teaching in Howard University Law’s evening program. Eventually he became dean of the Howard University Law School. Houston’s legal accomplishments eventually captured the attention of Walter White, the chief executive of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). In 1935, Houston was hired as Special Counsel to the Association. Eventually, he brought Thurgood Marshall, one of his Howard University law students, into the NAACP. The pair traveled through the South in the early 1930s and noted the inequalities of black school facilities. In response, they developed the legal strategy which challenged school segregation, first calling for the equalization of facilities for black students and then eventually calling for full integration. Houston and Marshall first applied their strategy in 1935 when they took the Pearson v. Murray case, one of the first challenges to racial exclusion in public universities. Donald Gaines Murray, an Amherst graduate, was denied admission to the University of Maryland School of Law on the basis of his race. Houston and Marshall successfully argued that the state had violated Murray’s rights by failing to provide an adequate law school for his studies while denying him admission to the sole state law school on the grounds of race. Houston continued to work with Marshall for the next fifteen years, laying the groundwork for the eventual Brown decision. Charles Hamilton Houston died on April 22, 1950 in Washington, DC at the age of 54, four years before the Supreme Court handed down the fateful decision that he had spent a lifetime planning and pursuing.",

        "summary": "Poet, novelist, playwright, librettist, essayist, and translator, James Mercer Langston Hughes was born in Joplin, Missouri on February 1, 1902, to parents Caroline (Carrie) Mercer Langston, a school teacher, and James Nathaniel Hughes, an attorney. His parents separated before Langston was born and he spent his pre-adolescent years with his maternal grandmother, Mary Patterson Langston, in Lawrence, Kansas. Mary Langston was the second wife of Charles Henry Langston, a major black political activist in Kansas, and the sister-in-law of former U.S. Congressman John Mercer Langston. After his grandmother’s death, Caroline married Homer Clark, a steel mill worker in Lincoln, Illinois. The couple settled in Cleveland, Ohio with Langston and his younger brother, Gwyn. Hughes was fiercely independent from an early age. When his mother and brother followed his stepfather who occasionally left the family in search of higher wages, Langston stayed in Cleveland to finish high school. He also had a volatile relationship with his attorney father who pursued work in Cuba and who by 1920 was general manager of an American company in Mexico. Langston Hughes joined his father in Mexico City briefly in 1919, moved back to Cleveland to complete high school, and then upon receiving his diploma in 1920, returned to Mexico City. Rather than acquiesce to his domineering father’s demands that he pursue a degree in mining engineering, Langston moved to New York City, New York and enrolled in Columbia University. Hughes quit Columbia after a year and decided to acquire a more worldly education. In 1922, he began a two-year stint as a ship’s crewman, during which he traveled to, and spent considerable time in, western Africa, France, and Italy. He also briefly lived in the expatriate community in London, England before returning to the United States in November 1924 to live with his mother in Washington, D.C. In 1925, he became the personal assistant of historian Carter G. Woodson, the founder of the Association for the Study of African American Life and History. In 1926, Hughes he enrolled in Lincoln University (Pennsylvania) and earned a liberal arts degree in 1930. His classmates included Thurgood Marshall, a future U.S. Supreme Court justice. While there, he joined Omega Psi Phi Fraternity. While in college, Hughes often returned to Harlem where he became a major figure in the Harlem Renaissance. Hughes deeply believed that black art should represent the experiences and culture of the black “folk.” Images of rural and urban working-class African Americans filled his poetry and prose, and his writing celebrated blues and jazz culture. Some of his more famous works associated with the Harlem Renaissance include the collections of poems, The Weary Blues (1926) and Fine Clothes to the Jew (1927); the novel Not Without Laughter (1930); and the essay “The Negro Artist and the Racial Mountain” (1926). Hughes was also politically engaged. During the 1930s, he wrote plays highlighting the injustice of the Scottsboro case and the imprisonment of the black Communist organizer, Angelo Herndon. In 1932, he was among a group of prominent black intellectuals who traveled to the Soviet Union to participate in an ultimately aborted film about black workers in the U.S. After realizing the film would not be made, Hughes decided to use the opportunity to travel across the Soviet Union to learn more about the world’s first Communist nation. During his travels, he spend a brief period in Turkmenistan (then part of the Soviet Union but now an independent nation) before traveling on to China and Japan. Between 1934 and 1935, Hughes lived in California, where he completed one novel and co-wrote the screenplay for the Hollywood film, Way Down South. In 1937, Hughes spent several months in Spain during its civil war as a correspondent for the Baltimore Afro-American and a supporter of the anti-fascist forces. Even though Hughes began to distance himself from the left after World War II, he was enveloped by the anti-communist hysteria of the Cold War era and testified before Sen. Joseph McCarthy’s Subcommittee on Un-American Activities in 1953. Hughes wrote sixteen books of poetry, twelve novels and short stories, and eight children’s books. His honors and awards included a Guggenheim Fellowship (1934), Rosenwald Fellowship (1941), the Ainsfield-Wolf Book Award (1954), and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) Spingarn Award (1960). By the early 1940s, Hughes ceased his peripatetic lifestyle and settled permanently in Harlem. However, he continued to write and interact with fellow Harlem Renaissance writers, such as Arna Bontemps, as well as younger writers he sought to encourage like Alice Walker. Langston Hughes died in Harlem on May 22, 1967, at the age of 65. James Mercer Langston Hughes’ ashes are interred beneath a floor medallion in the foyer of the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture.",

        "summary": "Zora Neale Hurston, known for her audacious spirit and sharp wit, was a talented and prolific writer and a skilled anthropologist from the Harlem (New York) Renaissance to the Civil Rights Era. Born on January 7, 1891 in Notasulga, Alabama, she grew up in the all-black town of Eatonville, Florida. Her idyllic life in this provincial rural town was shattered with the death of her mother when Hurston was 14 and her father’s unexpected remarriage. In a few years Hurston was on her own working as a maid. She settled in Baltimore, Maryland and completed her education at Morgan Academy and Howard University. Hurston’s talent was readily apparent to her professors including Alain Locke and Montgomery Gregory. With Locke’s and Gregory’s support her short story “John Redding Goes to Sea” was published in Howard’s literary magazine Stylus in 1921. Locke recommended Hurston’s work to Charles S. Johnson, who in 1924 published her second short story, “Drenched in Light” in Opportunity magazine. In September 1925 Hurston entered Barnard College, where she studied anthropology with the distinguished scholar Franz Boas. She received her B.A. in 1928. Throughout this period, however, Hurston continued to write. In June 1925 her short story “Spunk” was published in Opportunity. In collaboration with Langston Hughes and Wallace Thurman, Hurston in the late 1920s edited the short-lived magazine Fire! Collaborating with Langston Hughes, in 1930 she wrote her first play titled Mule Bone, a comedy about African American rural folk life. Four years later Hurston published her first novel, Jonah’s Gourd Vine, loosely based on the life of her father, a rural minister. In 1935 she authored Mules and Men, a volume of anthropological folklore. Hurston’s most famous work, Their Eyes Were Watching God, was published in 1937 followed by Moses, Man of the Mountain in 1939, and Seraph on the Suwanee, the least successful of her works, in 1948. Her autobiography, Dust Tracks on a Road, appeared in 1942. Hurston’s final years were marked by poverty, difficulty with writing, and estrangement from her family. Though ill, she remained independent until the end. Zora Neale Hurston died in obscurity and was buried in an unmarked grave in January 1960.",

        "summary": "Long before he became a minister, head of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference’s Operation Breadbasket, Operation PUSH (People United to Save Humanity), and founder of the Rainbow Coalition, Jesse Louis Jackson impressed his family and close friends as a person destined for greatness. Born Jesse Burns in Greenville, South Carolina on October 8, 1941 to Helen Burns, a 17 year old unwed high school student and Noah Robinson, her older married neighbor, young Jesse took the surname Jackson from his adopted father, Charles Jackson, who later married Burns. Insecure owing to the circumstances of his birth, Jackson decided to make himself a father figure and leader of his people. Tall and imposing at 6’ 4”, Jackson became a star high school quarterback and earned a football scholarship at the University of Illinois in 1959. After one year at Illinois he transferred to North Carolina Agricultural and Technical (A & T) University in Greensboro, North Carolina partly because he was not allowed to play quarterback. At A & T, Jackson used his oratorical skills and charismatic personality to become the student body president. Encouraged to test his leadership skills, Jackson led his first march to downtown Greensboro in 1962. Under the guidance of A & T President, Dr. Samuel Proctor, Jackson enrolled at the Chicago Theological Seminary where he planned to train for the ministry. Jackson was ordained a Baptist minister in 1968 although he left the Seminary two years earlier to work full time in the Civil Rights Movement. Jackson’s introduction to the Movement came in 1965 when he traveled to Selma, Alabama to join in the campaign for voting rights. While there Jackson met Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., the man who would launch his career as a national civil rights leader. Through King’s influence, Jackson quickly established himself prominently within King’s organization, the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. When SCLC launched its first northern campaign in Chicago in 1966, Jackson was put in charge of its Operation Breadbasket which used boycotts and selective buying campaigns to win contracts for black businesses and jobs for black workers. During the years Jackson headed Operation Breadbasket (1966 to 1971), the campaign generated over three thousand jobs for Southside Chicago residents and enlarged the income of the area by $22 million. Despite its success, Jackson and Rev. Ralph Abernathy, Dr. Martin Luther King’s successor at SCLC, clashed. In 1971, Jackson left the organization and found Operation PUSH where he continued his campaign of economic empowerment. By the early 1980s Jackson had acquired a national reputation as a racial justice activist. That reputation was enhanced when in 1983 he traveled to Syria and made a dramatic personal appeal to Syrian President Hafez al-Assad to secure the release of a captured American pilot, Navy Lt. Robert Goodman, who had been shot down over Lebanon. In June 1984 Jackson traveled to Havana to meet with Cuban President Fidel Castro to negotiate the release of 22 Americans being held by Castro’s government. In 1984, following the success of his Syrian mission, Jesse Jackson mounted the second major effort by an African American (after Shirley Chisholm in 1972) to seek the Democratic nomination for President of the United States. He and his followers adopted the term “Rainbow Coalition” to describe the broad coalition of groups of color, working poor, gays and lesbians, and white progressives that Jackson hoped would propel him to the nomination and eventually the White House. Despite controversial anti-Semitic remarks made during the campaign, Jackson ran a surprisingly strong race, winning primaries in five states including Michigan. Jackson garnered 21% of the primary vote but gained only 8% of the delegates and ultimately lost the nomination to former Vice President Walter Mondale. Jackson mounted a second effort in 1988, this time winning more than seven million primary votes across the nation in another failed attempt to win the nomination. After winning the South Carolina primary, finishing second in the Illinois primary and winning the Democratic caucus in Michigan, Jackson became the Democratic frontrunner. Massachusetts Governor Michael Dukakis recaptured the lead with wins in the Colorado and Wisconsin primaries forcing Jackson to drop out of the race. Jesse Jackson did not make another bid for the presidential nomination and since 1992 has functioned as a power broker within the Democratic Party. In 1990 he won the largely ceremonial position of District of Columbia’s statehood senator, a platform from which he argued for statehood for the nation’s capital. In 1997 Jackson launched the Wall Street Project which encouraged African Americans to become stockholders to use their leverage to force changes in corporate culture and behavior. Two years later Jackson engaged in personal diplomacy once again when during the Kosovo War he traveled to Belgrade to meet with Yugoslav (now Serbia) president Slobodan Milosevic where he secured the release of three U.S. prisoners of war. In the same year, 1999, he brokered a cease-fire in war-ravaged Sierra Leone. Both his supporters and critics describe Jackson as bold, defiant, and controversial. He has elicited praise for inspiring the poor with speeches punctuated by catchword phrases such as “I am somebody” and “keep hope alive.” Critics, however, blamed Jackson for mounting blatantly self-promoting campaigns that exploited racial grievances and inflamed racial outrage. The revelation that Jackson, married since 1962, fathered a child in 2001 with Rainbow Coalition staffer Karin Stanford, sullied his well-crafted public image as a moral leader. Nevertheless, Jesse Jackson remains enormously popular both in the United States and abroad.",

        "summary": "Jack Johnson, the first African American and first Texan to win the heavyweight boxing championship of the world, was born the second of six children to Henry and Tiny Johnson in Galveston on March 31, 1878. His parents were former slaves. To help support his family, Jack Johnson left school in the fifth grade to work on the dock in his port city hometown. In the 1890s Johnson began boxing as a teenager in “battles royal” matches where white spectators watched black men fight and at the end of the contest tossed money at the winner. Johnson turned professional in 1897 but four years later he was arrested and jailed because boxing was at that time a criminal sport in Texas. After his release from jail he left Texas to pursue the title of “Negro” heavyweight boxing champion. Although he made a good living as a boxer, Johnson for six years sought a title fight with the white heavyweight champion, James J. Jeffries. Jeffries denied Johnson and other African American boxers a shot at his title and he retired undefeated in 1904. Nevertheless, Johnson’s reputation as a skilled ring tactician continued to grow as he defeated both black and white boxers. Finally, in 1908, Johnson fought a white champion Tommy Burns in Australia for $30,000, then the highest purse in boxing history. Johnson knocked out Burns in the 14th round to become the first African American heavyweight champion of the world. Johnson’s capture of the title initiated a search among white promoters for a “great white hope” to defeat the black champion and reclaim the title for white America. They eventually lured Jim Jeffries out of retirement to face Johnson. On July 4, 1910, in what would be billed as the “Battle of the Century,” Johnson finally fought and beat Jeffries in Reno, Nevada to retain his title. Newspapers warned Johnson and his supporters against gloating over the victory. Nonetheless, scores of African Americans and some whites died as a result of the race rioting that broke out in cities across the nation in response to Johnson’s victory. In fear of more race riots, the Texas legislature banned all films showing the black fighter’s wins over any of his white opponents. Johnson also attracted considerable condemnation because of his unabashed sexual relationships with numerous white women. In 1913, Johnson fled the United States because federal officials charged him with violating the Mann Act, which prohibited the transportation of women across state lines for prostitution, debauchery, or immoral acts. While in exile in Cuba, Johnson lost his title in 1914 to little known white boxer Jess Willard. Failing to get other matches abroad, Johnson returned to the U.S. in 1920 to surrender to Federal authorities. He was tried and convicted for violation of the Mann Act and sentenced to a year and a day in the Federal penitentiary at Leavenworth, Kansas. Ironically, Johnson was appointed athletic director of the prison while still an inmate. Upon his release from prison in 1921, he returned to the ring, participating only in exhibition fights. Promoters never again gave Johnson another title shot. Jack Johnson married three white women in succession, Etta Duryea, Lucille Cameron, and Irene Pineau, but those unions failed to produce children. On October 6, 1946, after a North Carolina diner denied him service, he stormed out of the business and soon afterwards crashed his car. Johnson died from the impact. He was 68. The Boxing Hall of Fame posthumously inducted Johnson in 1954 and he received the same honor from the International Boxing Hall of Fame in 1990.",

        "summary": "James Weldon Johnson, composer, diplomat, social critic, and civil rights activist, was born of Bahamian immigrant parents in Jacksonville, Florida on June 17, 1871. Instilled with the value of education by his father James, a waiter, and his mother Helen, a teacher, Johnson excelled at the Stanton School in Jacksonville. In 1889, he entered Atlanta University in Georgia, graduating in 1894. In 1896, Johnson began to study law in Thomas Ledwith’s law office in Jacksonville, Florida. In 1898, Ledwith considered Johnson ready to take the Florida bar exam. After a grueling two-hour exam, Johnson was given a pass and admitted to the bar. One examiner expressed his anguish by bolting from the room and stating, “Well, I can’t forget he’s a nigger; and I’ll be damned if I’ll stay here to see him admitted.” In 1898, Johnson became one of only a handful of black attorneys in the state. Johnson, however, did not practice law. Instead, he became principal at the Stanton School in Jacksonville, where he improved the curriculum and also added the ninth and tenth grades. Johnson also started the first black newspaper, the Daily American, in Jacksonville. With his brother Rosamond, who had been trained at the New England Conservatory of Music in Massachusetts, Johnson’s interests turned to songwriting for Broadway. Rosamond and James migrated to New York in 1902 and were soon earning over twelve thousand dollars a year by selling their songs to Broadway performers. Upon a return trip to Florida in 1900, the brothers were asked to write a celebratory song in honor of Abraham Lincoln’s birthday. The product, a poem set to music, became “Lift Every Voice and Sing,” now known as the Black National Anthem. In 1906, Johnson became United States consul to Puerto Cabello in Venezuela. While in the foreign service, he met his future wife, Grace Nail, the daughter of influential black New York City real estate speculator, John E. Nail. The couple’s first year was spent in Corinto, Nicaragua, Johnson’s diplomatic post. While in the diplomatic service, Johnson had begun to write his most famous literary work, The Autobiography of An Ex-Colored Man. This novel, published in 1912, became a work of note during the Harlem Renaissance of the 1920s. In 1914, Johnson became an editor for the New York Age. He soon gained notoriety when W.E.B. DuBois published Johnson’s critique of D.W. Griffith’s The Birth of a Nation in the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) publication The Crisis. Johnson was a member of Sigma Pi Phi Fraternity and Phi Beta Sigma Fraternity. In 1916, Johnson became Field Secretary for the NAACP and dramatically increased NAACP membership and the number of branches. In 1917, he organized the famous “Silent March” down 5th Avenue to protest racial violence and lynching. The march, which numbered approximately ten thousand participants, was the largest protest organized by African Americans to that point. Johnson’s participation in the campaign against lynching continued for the next two decades. Although he was a nationally recognized civil rights leader, Johnson continued to write and critique poetry in a column for the New York Age. His “Poetry Corner” column, published in 1922 as The Book of American Negro Poetry, became an important contribution to the emerging Harlem Renaissance particularly because of its inclusion of Claude McKay’s “If We Must Die.” Johnson’s other Harlem Renaissance contributions included The Book of American Negro Spirituals (1925), God’s Trombones (1927), and Seven Negro Sermons in Verse (1927). In 1930, Johnson published Black Manhattan, a Social History of Black New York, and three years later (in 1933) his autobiography, Along This Way, appeared. Johnson resigned from the NAACP in 1930 and accepted a faculty position in creative writing and literature at Fisk University. He maintained an active life in teaching and public speaking until he died in an automobile accident on June 26, 1938, while vacationing in Wiscasset, Maine . He was 67 at the time of his death.",

Johnson moved to Chicago in 1932 where he attended school and graduated with honors in 1936. He attended the University of Chicago and Northwestern University but did not complete his degree. Over his lifetime, Johnson received numerous honorary degrees, including five doctorates. After working varied jobs for a few years, in 1942 with $500.00 derived from mortgaging his mother’s furniture, Johnson sold subscriptions and with the proceeds published Negro Digest (later renamed Black World). The format was copied from Reader’s Digest, a literary magazine. Three years later Johnson started Ebony, a magazine modeled after the successful pictorial publication, Life magazine. In 1951 Johnson began publishing Jet magazine, a weekly periodical which reported news and developments relevant to African Americans. To oversee his publications Johnson created Johnson Publishing Company in a small office in South Chicago and moved to a larger building in downtown Chicago in 1971. One year later the Magazine Publishers Association elected Johnson “Magazine Publisher of the Year.” In 1982, Johnson became the first African American to appear on Forbes list of wealthiest Americans. Johnson’s empire eventually combined publishing, cosmetics, and insurance. In 1996 President Bill Clinton awarded Johnson the Presidential Medal of Freedom. John H. Johnson was a member of Alpha Phi Alpha and Sigma Pi Phi fraternities. One of the largest black-owned businesses in the United States, Johnson Publishing Company was a major producer of African American magazines that focused on the accomplishments of black Americans. Providing a much needed forum for black Americans and with a national scope, these magazines explored issues, reported events, and discussed people as they related to needs and concerns of black Americans. Johnson became involved in politics and the civil rights movement. He supported Martin Luther King, Jr., thoroughly reported civil rights efforts, befriended Jesse Jackson, and was a benefactor of Howard University. Johnson encouraged and applauded African American successes while reporting their problems. His life, as he viewed it, can be glimpsed in his best-selling autobiography, Succeeding Against the Odds.",

His parents Elizabeth Lena Adams, a school teacher, and James Sumner Julian, a railroad mail clerk who loved mathematics, raised six children, all of whom pursued a college education. Two sons became physicians, and three daughters received M.A. degrees. After attending public school in Montgomery, Julian moved to Greencastle, Indiana in 1916 to enroll at DePauw University. While at DePauw he was named a member of the Sigma Xi honorary society and Phi Beta Kappa. In order to finance his college education, he worked as a waiter and a ditch digger. Julian was selected as the class valedictorian upon his graduation in 1920. After completing his undergraduate degree, Julian was determined to earn a doctorate in chemistry despite the racism which prevented African Americans from pursuing graduate degrees in all but a handful of universities. Between 1920 and 1922, Percy Julian taught chemistry at Fisk University while earning an M.A. from Harvard University which he received in 1923. From 1926 to 1927, he taught chemistry at West Virginia State College, and he became the chair of the chemistry department at Howard University in 1928. In 1929, Julian was awarded a fellowship from the Rockefeller Foundation that allowed him to finally pursue his doctorate. Julian left the United States to study at the University of Vienna (Austria), where he earned his Ph.D. in 1931. Julian briefly returned to the chemistry department at Howard University, but by 1933, he was a research fellow at DePauw University, where he published several peer-reviewed articles in the Journal of the American Chemical Society. In 1936, Julian left DePauw and became the Director of Research of the Soya Products Division at Glidden (Chicago, Illinois), where he was the first black scientist hired by the firm. While a chemist at Glidden, he developed an inexpensive process to prepare cortisone, which is used in the treatment of arthritis. He also developed a flame retardant used by the U.S. Navy in World War II which saved the lives of a number of sailors. In 1953, Percy Julian established the Julian Laboratories, which produced steroid-containing compounds. He subsequently hired many African American scientists who shared his interest in a career in the scientific field. In 1961, he sold Julian Laboratories for two million dollars. Over the course of his career, Dr. Percy Julian had over 100 peer-reviewed publications and 115 research patents. In 1973, he was elected into the National Academy of Sciences. Julian was also a member of Sigma Pi Phi fraternity. Percy Julian died of liver cancer at his home in Waukegan, Illinois on April 19, 1975. He was 76.",

        "summary": "Dr. Ernest E. Just was one of the first African Americans to receive worldwide recognition as a scientist. Born August 14, 1883 in Charleston, South Carolina, Just was only four years old when his father, Charles Fraser Just, died in 1887. Due to mounting debt, his mother, Mary Just, and her children moved from Charleston to James Island, a Gullah community off the coast of South Carolina, to work in its phosphate mines. Mary Just became a highly respected leader of the community and convinced a number of residents on the island to purchase land and start their own community. The residents renamed the community Maryville in her honor. In 1896, Just was sent to attend the high school of the Colored Normal Industrial, Agricultural & Mechanical College (later named South Carolina State University). Believing that he would receive a superior education by attending a college preparatory school in the North, Just enrolled in Kimball Union Academy in New Hampshire in 1900. Although he was Kimball Union’s only black student, Just recalled being in a warm and welcoming environment where he excelled in social activities and academics. After graduation from Kimball Union, Just entered Dartmouth College in 1903. In contrast to his experience at Kimball Union, Just felt alone and socially isolated at Dartmouth. Nonetheless, he graduated magna cum laude in biology with a minor in history in 1907. He was also elected to Phi Beta Kappa. Ernest Everett JustAfter receiving his degree, Just accepted a position at Howard University as an instructor of rhetoric and English. In 1910, he joined the Department of Biology and was appointed professor in 1912. While at Howard, Just helped to found Omega Psi Phi Fraternity in 1911. Omega Psi Phi was the first black Greek-lettered fraternal organization founded at a historically black university. Just later became a member of Sigma Pi Phi Fraternity. Just worked for many years at the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, Massachusetts. At the laboratory, Just realized that a doctorate in the sciences was key to his success, and he began a program of self-study at the University of Chicago. He earned a doctorate in zoology in 1916. Just published fifty scientific papers and two influential books, Basic Methods for Experiments on Eggs of Marine Mammals (1922) and Biology of the Cell Surface (1939). Despite having a Ph.D., Just could not find work at any major American university. He moved to Europe and continued his research in Naples, Italy. In 1930, however, Just became the first American to be invited to conduct research at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute in Berlin, Germany. His research ended when the Nazis took control of Germany in 1933. Just then relocated to Paris, France to continue his research. Just married Ethel Highwarden in 1912. The couple had three children, but the marriage suffered due to his long absences from home. He and Ethel divorced in 1939. That same year, Just married Maid Hedwig Schnetzler, a German national. Ernest Just was working at the Station Biologique in Roscoff, France when the Germans invaded the country. He was held briefly in a prisoner-of-war camp until rescued by the U.S. State Department and brought back to the U.S. in 1940. Just had been ill for months before his incarceration as a POW, but his condition deteriorated during his imprisonment and after his return to the United States. He died on October 27, 1941, in Washington, D.C., shortly after being diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. He was 58 years old.",

        "summary": "Maulana Karenga was born in Parsonsburg, Maryland, and moved to California in 1958 where he studied at Los Angeles City College (LACC) and UCLA. At LACC, he became involved in campus politics, was elected the first African American Study Body President, and was active in the civil rights, African independence, and peace movements. He also chaired the Los Angeles chapter of the Afro-American Association. Karenga transferred to UCLA, earning a B.A. (cum laude) (1963) and M.A. (1964) in political science with a specialization in African Studies. After a year of working on his doctorate, he left UCLA to work in the Black Freedom Movement. At UCLA he had begun to develop a philosophy of radical cultural and social change called Kawaida, which embraces some of the essential teachings of major activist intellectuals he studied, including Malcolm X, Marcus Garvey, Sékou Touré, Julius Nyerere, Kwame Nkrumah, Frantz Fanon, and Amílcar Cabral. Karenga stressed revolution as both cultural and political, and argued that cultural revolution precedes and makes possible the political revolution, for it transforms consciousness and forges the commitment to struggle. In the context of the cultural and political transformation called “Back to Black”, Karenga changed his European name, “Ron Everett,” to an African name, Maulana Karenga, which means “master teacher” and “keeper of the tradition” respectively. In 1965 after the Watts Revolt, Karenga created the organization, Us, (us African people), and structured it as a cultural and social change organization, with a paramilitary unit called Simba Wachanga (The Young Lions). Us engaged in programs of political and cultural education, organizing, institution-building and social service. Using his expansive knowledge of African culture and languages, Karenga, in 1965, also developed the Nguzo Saba (The Seven Principles), as a key value system for Black life and struggle, and in 1966, created the African American and pan-African holiday, Kwanzaa, a seven-day holiday (26 December—1 January) which celebrates family, community and culture. Karenga and Us have also played a major role in Black intellectual and political culture since the 1960’s, including the Movements of Black Power, Black Arts, Black Studies, Black Students, ancient Egyptian studies, reparations, and the Million Man March/Day of Absence, for which Karenga wrote the Mission Statement. In 1971, Karenga was convicted on charges of assault against members of his organization which he called “trumped up” and “politically motivated.” Karenga has consistently maintained his innocence and argues that he was one of many victims of the FBI Cointelpro whose announced efforts were to “discredit, disrupt and otherwise neutralize” all radical Black leadership. And Us and Karenga were cited in FBI documents as major targets for this repression. After what he calls his “political imprisonment,” Karenga returned to his doctorate studies and earned one Ph.D. in political science at United States International University (1976) and another in social ethics at the University of Southern California (1994). He currently is professor and former chair (13 years) of Africana Studies at California State University, Long Beach. He remains an activist-scholar, chairing Us and the National Association of Kawaida Organizations, and serving as executive director of the Kawaida Institute of Pan-African Studies and the African American Cultural Center, Los Angeles.",

        "summary": "One of the most visible advocates of nonviolence and direct action as methods of social change, Martin Luther King, Jr. was born in Atlanta, Georgia on January 15, 1929. As the grandson of the Rev. A.D. Williams, pastor of Ebenezer Baptist church and a founder of Atlanta’s NAACP chapter, and the son of Martin Luther King, Sr., who succeeded Williams as Ebenezer’s pastor, King’s roots were in the African American Baptist church. After attending Morehouse College in Atlanta, King went on to study at Crozer Theological Seminary in Pennsylvania and Boston University in Massachusetts, where he deepened his understanding of theological scholarship and explored Mahatma Gandhi’s nonviolent strategy for social change. King married Coretta Scott in 1953, and the following year he accepted the pastorate at Dexter Avenue Baptist Church in Montgomery, Alabama. King received his Ph.D. in systematic theology in 1955. On December 5, 1955, after civil rights activist Rosa Parks refused to comply with Montgomery’s segregation policy on buses, black residents launched a bus boycott and elected King president of the newly-formed Montgomery Improvement Association. The boycott continued throughout 1956 and King gained national prominence for his role in the campaign. In December 1956 the United States Supreme Court declared Alabama’s segregation laws unconstitutional and Montgomery buses were desegregated. Seeking to build upon the success in Montgomery, King and other southern black ministers founded the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) in Atlanta in 1957. In 1959, King toured India and further developed his understanding of Gandhian nonviolent strategies. Later that year, King resigned from Dexter and returned to Atlanta to become co-pastor of Ebenezer Baptist Church with his father. In 1960, black college students in Greensboro, North Carolina initiated a wave of sit-in protests that led to the formation of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC). King supported the student movement and expressed an interest in creating a youth arm of the SCLC. Student activists admired King, but they were critical of his top-down leadership style and were determined to maintain their autonomy. As an advisor to SNCC, Ella Baker, who had previously served as associate director of SCLC, made clear to representatives from other civil rights organizations that SNCC was to remain a student-led organization. The 1961 “Freedom Rides” heightened tensions between King and younger activists, as he faced criticism for his decision not to participate in the rides. Conflicts between SCLC and SNCC continued during the Albany (Georgia) Movement of 1961 and 1962. In the spring of 1963, King and SCLC lead mass demonstrations in Birmingham, Alabama, where local white police officials were known for their violent opposition to integration. Clashes between unarmed black demonstrators and police armed with dogs and fire hoses generated newspaper headlines throughout the world. President Kennedy responded to the Birmingham protests by submitting broad civil rights legislation to Congress, which led to the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Subsequent mass demonstrations culminated in the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom on August 28, 1963, in which more than 250,000 protesters gathered in Washington, D.C. It was on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial that King delivered his famous “I Have a Dream” speech. King’s renown continued to grow as he became Time magazine’s Man of the Year in 1963 and the recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo, Norway in 1964. However, along with the fame and accolades came conflict within the movement’s leadership. Malcolm X‘s message of self-defense and black nationalism resonated with northern, urban blacks more effectively than King’s call for nonviolence; King also faced public criticism from “Black Power” proponent, Stokely Carmichael. King’s efficacy was not only hindered by divisions among black leadership, but also by the increasing resistance he encountered from national political leaders. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) director J. Edgar Hoover’s extensive efforts to undermine King’s leadership were intensified during 1967 as urban racial violence escalated, and King’s public criticism of U.S. intervention in the Vietnam War led to strained relations with Lyndon Johnson’s administration. In late 1967, King initiated a Poor People’s Campaign designed to confront economic problems that had not been addressed by earlier civil rights reforms. The following year, while supporting striking sanitation workers in Memphis, Tennessee he delivered his final address “I’ve Been to the Mountaintop.” The next day, April 4, 1968, King was assassinated in Memphis. Dr. King was a member of both Alpha Phi Alpha and Sigma Pi Phi fraternities. To this day, Dr. Martin Luther King remains a controversial symbol of the African American civil rights struggle, revered by many for his martyrdom on behalf of nonviolence and condemned by others for his militancy and insurgent views.",

Her parents died when she was very young, so she was raised by her mother’s sister and the Chippewa people in Niagara Falls. Edmonia also had an older brother, Samuel Lewis, who migrated west during the California Gold Rush. Lewis made a small fortune in the gold fields, part of which he used to send Edmonia to Oberlin College in Ohio. Although the college was one of the first to admit African American women and men as well as white women, Lewis encountered racial problems. In 1862 she was accused of attempting to poison two white coeds. She was cleared of the charges but continued to be subject to verbal attacks and a beating that left her bedridden for days. Oberlin’s administration refused to allow her to enroll the next year to complete her graduation requirements. With Samuel’s financial help, Edmonia moved to Boston to study with master sculptor Edward A. Brackett. She soon became impatient with her apprenticeship status and decided to sculpt her own work. Again with her brother’s financial backing, Edmonia Lewis opened her own studio in Boston. In 1864, she created a sculpture of Colonel Robert Gould Shaw, the white commander of the all-black 54th Massachusetts Infantry Regiment. The sculpture became popular among Bostonians and she was soon able to sell over 100 plaster copies of the work. She also made medallion portraits of abolitionists such as John Brown and William Lloyd Garrison. With some money and notoriety, Lewis moved to Rome, Italy in 1865, an international center at the time of writers, poets, and artists, to continue her studies. She joined a large international artistic community that included other women sculptors such as Harriet Hosmer, Anne Whitney, Margaret Foley, and Emma Stebbins. Lewis began to work in marble and adopted the neoclassical style. She continued to find inspiration in the lives of abolitionists and Civil War heroes who were the subjects of virtually all of her work. Lewis’s sculptures of African, African American, or Native American people were particularly popular among American tourists in Rome. Some of her most famous works included Forever Free (1867) which depicted a black woman and black man celebrating the Emancipation Proclamation; Hagar in the Wilderness (1868), a sculpture of an Egyptian handmaiden; the Old Arrow Maker and His Daughter (1872) which showed Native Americans; and The Death of Cleopatra (1875) which was eventually acquired by the National Museum of Art in Washington, D.C. Edmonia Lewis disappeared from public view in the 1880s. Her last known sculpture appeared in 1883. She died in London, England on September 17, 1907.",

After earning his undergraduate degree in 1907, Locke attended Oxford University where he obtained another B.A degree in 1910. The following year he attended the University of Berlin in Germany. In 1912 Locke returned to the United States where he became an assistant professor of philosophy at Howard University in Washington, D.C., beginning an academic career that would span four decades. He also joined the newly organized Phi Beta Sigma Fraternity. In 1916 Locke interrupted his teaching career at Howard to return to Harvard University where he earned a Ph.D. in Philosophy. When Locke rejoined the faculty at Howard he quickly rose in rank and in 1921 became the chair of the Philosophy department. He remained in this position until his retirement in 1953. Locke was known as an engaging, talented, accessible and admired professor by both his students and his colleagues. He was a pioneer in interdisciplinary scholarship as his work transcended standard academic disciplines in the humanities and social sciences. Locke also embraced progressive, avant-garde, and, some would argue, unorthodox teaching methods while at Howard which were sometimes viewed with suspicion by more traditionally oriented colleagues and administrators at his institution. Alain Locke has been widely regarded as the originator of the New Negro Movement and the Harlem Renaissance. His main contribution to both movements was the promotion and emphasis on values, diversity, and race relations. He challenged African Americans to acknowledge and promote their cultural heritage while at the same time, making the effort to integrate into the larger society and appreciate the mores and customs of other ethnic groups. He also was a firm believer in W.E.B DuBois‘ Talented Tenth philosophy, yet, unlike DuBois, he remained socially attached to the general African American population and staunchly resisted any form of elitist behavior. Locke was a resourceful, intelligent, altruistic, and generous man who managed to serve as a mentor and establish close relationships with Langston Hughes, Countee Cullen, Jean Toomer, Rudolph Fisher, and Zora Neale Hurston. While Locke was never open about his homosexuality, his sexuality contributed to his various sensibilities and would frequently manifest itself in his works. Alain Locke died on June 9, 1954 in New York City, New York at the age of 68.",

        "summary": "Joe Louis Barrow, known popularly as Joe Louis, was the second African American heavyweight boxing champion in the 20th Century. Louis was born on May 13, 1914 in Chambers County Alabama to sharecropper parents Monroe and Lilly Reese Barrow. He was the seventh of eight children and grandson of slaves. In 1926, Barrow’s family, like thousands of southern African American families, migrated to Detroit. While only in his teens Barrow began boxing at Brewster’s East Side Gymnasium in Detroit. At 19, he entered the Golden Gloves finals in 1933 as a light heavyweight and eventually became the champion in his weight class. Louis turned professional in 1934 and dropped the name Barrow. Louis won a remarkable 12 bouts in his first year as a professional. His career ascended quickly, and by 1935 he earned over $350,000 in purses, when the average yearly salary in the United States during the Great Depression was about $1,200. He gave generously to charities and friends. Louis became an icon for African Americans and a hero to many white Americans, as well. Louis won his first 27 fights—all but four by knockout. During this period, he convincingly defeated such heavyweight greats as Primo Carnera, Stanley Poreda, Natie Brown, and Max Baer. Known as the “Brown Bomber,” Louis’s most memorable encounters were his matches against German champion Max Schmeling. In 1936, Schmeling knocked Louis out for the first time in his career. Nevertheless, in 1937, after fighting several other contenders, Louis began a 12 year reign as heavyweight champion by knocking out James Braddock. A rematch with Schmeling occurred in June 1938 which, despite the wishes of the fighters, became a symbol of the growing political conflict between Germany and the United States. Louis knocked Schmeling out in the first round and immediately became a national hero. During World War II, Louis enlisted in the Army. As a soldier, Louis served his country by participating in exhibition matches to raise money for the military and to boost soldier morale. Louis returned to the ring in 1946 and in the next three years defended his defended his title four times, including consecutive victories against “Jersey” Joe Walcott. Louis retired in 1949, as the undefeated heavyweight champ. Financial pressures including mounting federal tax debts forced Louis back into the ring at age 37. In 1950, he attempted to recapture his title in a bout against Ezzard Charles. However, in a points decision, Louis was handed a loss. Not ready to accept defeat, he challenged the next champion, Rocky Marciano in 1951. During the 8th round of the bout, Marciano knocked Louis through the ropes. This was Joe Louis’s final time in the ring. Although he had earned more than $5 million in his seventeen year boxing career and had served his country during World War II, Louis retired penniless. To support himself, Louis became a Las Vegas casino greeter. Louis was married four times. With his wives he had two biological children and adopted three other children. Louis continued to suffer from severe financial problems, and by the 1960s his health began to deteriorate. At one point he was a patient at a Denver, Colorado psychiatric facility. Joe Louis died on April 12, 1981. President Ronald Reagan ordered the veteran buried in Arlington National Cemetery with full military honors.",

        "summary": "Thurgood Marshall was an American civil rights activist with the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) and the first African American to serve on the Supreme Court of the United States. He is remembered as a lawyer who had one of the highest rates of success before the Supreme Court and the principal counsel in a number of landmark court cases. Marshall won 29 of the 32 cases he argued before the high court. Marshall was born on July 2, 1908 in Baltimore, Maryland, the great-grandson of a slave. His father, William Marshall, a railroad porter, instilled in him an appreciation of the Constitution at an early age. When young Marshall got in trouble at school he was required to memorize sections of the US Constitution. His mother, Norma Arica Williams, an elementary school teacher for 25 years, placed great emphasis on his overall scholarship. Marshall grew up in Baltimore, graduating from Frederick Douglass High School in the city in 1925 and from Lincoln University in Pennsylvania in 1930. Marshall, who had decided to become an attorney, was rejected by the University of Maryland School of Law in 1930 because of his race. He instead entered Howard University Law School, graduating in 1933. After initially setting up a private practice in Baltimore, he in 1934 began his long history with the NAACP. He won his first major legal victory as an NAACP lawyer the following year on behalf of Donald Gaines Murray, a black student, who like Marshall was also denied admission to the University of Maryland Law School. With that victory Marshall now realized the courts could be a powerful weapon against racial discrimination. Marshall’s most famous case was the legal challenge on behalf of Linda Brown and twelve other plaintiffs that would result in the U.S. Supreme Court’s landmark Brown v. Board of Education ruling in 1954. Here the high court struck down an earlier Supreme Court’s 1896 ruling in Plessy v. Ferguson, declaring that “separate but equal” public education was unconstitutional. Numerous legal scholars contend that this ruling was one of the most important and far reaching in the history of the U.S. Supreme Court and of the nation. President John F. Kennedy appointed Thurgood Marshall to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in 1961. With this appointment Marshall began his career as a jurist. On June 13, 1967 President Lyndon Baines Johnson appointed Marshall to the Supreme Court. He was confirmed as an Associate Justice by the United States Senate by a vote of 69-11 on August 30, 1967. Marshall served on the high Court for the next twenty four years, compiling a liberal human rights record that included strong support for the civil rights of people of color and for constitutional protection of individual rights, especially the rights of criminal suspects against the government. Justice Marshall also worked closely with Justice William Brennan in helping to craft the Roe v. Wade Decision of 1973 which supported abortion rights. He also opposed the death penalty. In 1972, Marshall argued in Furman v. Georgia that the death penalty was, in all circumstances, unconstitutional. During his years on the Court Marshall was often called the silent revolutionary who viewed the United States Constitution was an evolving shield of freedom. In a 1987 speech he gave for the bicentennial celebration of the United States Constitution, Marshall claimed the government the founding fathers devised was defective from the start; requiring several amendments, a Civil War, and major social transformations to attain the Constitutional guarantees and respect for freedoms and individual rights that the nation holds as fundamental today. Thurgood Marshall was married twice, first to Vivian Burey from 1929 to her death in February 1955 and later to Cecilia Suyat from December 1955 until his death. He and his second wife had two sons. Justice Thurgood Marshall retired from the Court in 1991 and died in 1993 in Bethesda, Maryland of heart failure at the age of 84.",

        "summary": "Benjamin Mays, Christian minister, scholar, advocate for justice, and an educator, was born in Ninety-Six, South Carolina on August 1, 1894, the youngest of eight children. His parents, Louvenia Carter and Hezekiah Mays, were tenant farmers and former slaves. Mays attended Virginia Union University before transferring to Bates College in Maine, where he earned a B.A. In 1920, he entered the University of Chicago earning an M.A. (1925) and a Ph.D. (1935) in the School of Religion. His education was interrupted by leaves of absence as a pastor of Shiloh Baptist Church in Atlanta, and stints as a teacher at Morehouse College and South Carolina State College (SCSC) as well as by his work with the National Urban League and the YMCA. While teaching at SCSC, he met Sadie Gray, whom he married in 1926. Throughout his life he spoke out against racial inequality and for education. From 1934 to 1940, Mays served as the dean of the Howard University School of Religion. During his tenure he established the School as one the premier institutions in the nation. He traveled abroad extensively including a 1936 voyage to India, where he met with Mahatma Gandhi. In 1940, Mays left Howard to become the president of Morehouse College. At Morehouse, Mays was an unparalleled fundraiser who also greatly improved the academic reputation of the school. Mays also influenced generations of African American men who attended Morehouse, imparting a value for education, a belief in the dignity of all human beings, and a desire to combat racial inequality. He served as a mentor for a cadre of civil rights activists which included Martin Luther King, Jr. and Julian Bond. By the late 1960s Mays became a vocal critic of radical organizations such as the Black Panther Party for Self-Defense. They, in turn, denounced Mays’s moderate approach to attaining racial equality. In addition to Mays’s ministry and guidance at Howard University and Morehouse College, he was one of the foremost scholars of the Black Church. In 1933 he published one of the first sociological studies of African American religion, The Negro’s Church. He published a series of books on African Americans and religion including: The Negro’s God as Reflected in His Literature (1938); Fifty Years of Progress in the Negro Church (1950); The Christian in Race Relations (1952); The Church and Racial Tensions (1954); Disturbed About Man (1969) and an autobiography entitled, Born to Rebel (1971). Mays was also an active member of the National Baptist Convention, the National Council of Churches, and the World Council of Churches. He was a member of both Omega Psi Phi and Sigma Pi Phi fraternities. By 1967, Mays had retired from Morehouse and was elected to the Atlanta Board of Education. He served as president in 1970, offering guidance during the tense period of desegregation of the city’s public schools. In recognition of his life’s work promoting racial justice and African American education, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) awarded him the Spingarn Medal.

Once the McCoy family settled in Canada, they were extremely poor. Nonetheless they saved money for their son to get an education. When Elijah was 15 years old, he was sent to a boarding school in Edinburgh, Scotland to study mechanical engineering. Once he returned to the United States, McCoy had a difficult time in finding a job because of his race despite his numerous credentials. He eventually settled for a menial job as a fireman for the Michigan Central Railroad oiling the various working parts of the trains. These tasks were slow and boring for the certified mechanical engineer who began to wonder why the moving parts of the train couldn’t oil themselves. From this, he became interested in the challenges of self-lubrication for machines and began to test various ideas for automatic lubrication. The Elijah McCoy Manufacturing Company opened in 1870 in Detroit. On July 2, 1872, McCoy had his first patent guaranteed invention, the “lubricator cup.” This device dropped continuous amounts of oil onto the moving parts of the machine. The lubricator cup saved companies from losing time and money in frequently stopping machines to have them manually oiled. This invention also earned McCoy world-wide recognition and created a new phrase, “Real McCoy” to describe any instrument or process that is flawless in quality and performance. McCoy refined his invention over the next 25 years, receiving over 50 patents for updating and modifying the lubricator cup. Elijah McCoy died in Detroit in 1929.",

        "summary": "Harlem Renaissance writer Festus Claudius McKay was born on September 15, 1889, in Sunny Ville, in the Clarendon Hills of Jamaica, to peasant farmers Hannah Ann Elizabeth Edwards and Thomas Frank McKay. Young Claude was tutored by his elder schoolmaster brother, Uriah Theodore McKay, who introduced him to a library dominated by the ideas of the great free thinkers, particularly Thomas Huxley and Herbert Spencer. While working in Kingston as a constable, McKay became the protégé of Walter Jekyll, a British aristocrat and anthropologist who also placed his personal library at Claude McKay’s disposal. McKay published his first two volumes of poetry, Songs of Jamaica (1912) and Constab Ballads (1912), written in the island’s rich dialect, before migrating to America to study agronomy at Booker T. Washington’s Tuskegee Institute in Alabama and later at Kansas State University. By 1917, however, he was no longer in college and living in Harlem. McKay’s very formal sonnets, “Harlem Shadows” and “Innovations,” published in the Liberator in 1917, place him among the founders of the emerging Harlem Renaissance. Yet his militant sonnets: “If We Must Die,” “The White House,” and “America,” first published in 1919, best epitomized the uncompromising “voice” of this “New Negro movement.” With the publication of Spring in New Hampshire (1920) and Harlem Shadows (1922) during the early years of the Harlem Renaissance, McKay emerged as one of its significant poets. While many literary critics and historians point to the militant voices of McKay’s speakers and the radicalism of his associates on the political left, and especially the Communist Party in the early 1920, McKay remained an incurable Romantic, infected by the pastoral legacies of agrarian Jamaica. Claude McKay wrote three novels: Home to Harlem (1929), Banjo (1929), and Banana Bottom (1932). He also published a collection of short stories titled Gingertown in 1932. Written during an era where black writers often pandered to the stereotypes of the primitive exotic, Home to Harlem pulsates with controversial stereotypes: cabaret scenes, boozers, jazzers, and dancers. While the novel was a financial success, it met mixed reviews. While Langston Hughes and other Renaissance writers praised the work, W.E.B. DuBois found little merit in the volume. In his review for Crisis, the official publication of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), Dr. DuBois wrote that he felt “unclean and in need of a bath” after reading the novel. While neither Banjo nor Banana Bottom were financial successes, reviewers generally praised them and considered the latter book, a romantic tale set in the pastoral world of Jamaica, to be McKay’s best novel. McKay wrote two autobiographies: A Long Way from Home (1937) and My Green Hills of Jamaica (published posthumously in 1979); and a collection of essays, Harlem: Negro Metropolis (1940). His collection of poems, Selected Poems of Claude McKay (1953), was also published posthumously. Although an atheist most his life, McKay joined the Catholic Church in 1944. Claude McKay died four years later in Chicago, on May 22, 1948, at the age of 59.",

        "summary": "Oscar Micheaux was the quintessential self-made man. Novelist, film-maker and relentless self-promoter, Micheaux was born on a farm near Murphysboro, Illinois. He worked briefly as a Pullman porter and then in 1904 homesteaded nearly 500 acres of land near the Rosebud Sioux Indian Reservation in South Dakota. Micheaux published novels in Nebraska and New York and made movies in Chicago, Illinois and Los Angeles, California. Micheaux left “autobiographical” records in his first three novels, The Conquest (1913), The Forged Note (1915) and The Homesteader (1917), in which his protagonists play out a young black man’s life in rural, white South Dakota. Micheaux began his career with door-to-door sales of his early writings to neighboring farmers. Encouraged by the modest success from his first novel, Micheaux gave up farming to write six other novels about this period and region. D.W. Griffith’s powerful and vitriolically anti-black movie The Birth of a Nation ironically impressed upon Micheaux the ability of a filmmaker to tell a complex, multi-character story every bit as compelling as a novel. Oscar Micheaux soon got the opportunity to test his theory in 1918 when he was contacted by the black-owned Lincoln Film Company in Nebraska to adapt his third novel, The Homesteader, to film. Micheaux rejected the offer and instead moved to Chicago where he made his own film version of his novel. The Homesteader was the first full-length feature film written, produced and directed by an African American. It was also a commercial success when it grossed over $5,000. Oscar Micheaux’s desire to control the production and distribution of his films was be the hallmark of his career. He persuaded the best black actors of his time to work in forty-four, mostly low-budget, films he produced between 1919 and 1948 that appealed to the rapidly growing black urban audiences of the post-World War I period. Most of Micheaux’s films were detective stories, quickly written, filmed, edited and released. His African American audiences rarely complained since they were starved to see people on the silver screen who looked like they did. Micheaux on occasion tackled more complex subjects in his films. Within Our Gates, his fifth film, specifically attacked the racism portrayed in The Birth of a Nation. He also took on controversial subjects in the black community including interracial romance, skin color hypocrisy and corrupt clergymen. Significantly, his films in the 1920s and 1930s contrasted sharply with the Hollywood image of blacks as lazy, ignorant and sexually aggressive. Many white critics decried Micheaux’s amateur movie-making skills, yet his audiences devoured his product, making him the most successful black writer, producer and director in the United States until his death in Charlotte, North Carolina in 1951. Eventually Hollywood recognized both Micheaux’s genius and his crucial role in opening opportunities for African Americans in front of and behind the motion picture camera. In 1987, Oscar Micheaux was memorialized with a Hollywood Walk of Fame “Star.” Two years later, he was given posthumous awards by the Black Filmmakers Hall of Fame (1989) and the Director’s Guild of America (1989).

Miller grew to 6 feet 3 inches, weighed over 200 pounds, and played football at Waco’s A.J. Moore Academy. He dropped out of school at the age of seventeen and enlisted in the US Navy in 1939 at the age of twenty. He was made a mess attendant, one the few positions available to African Americans at the time. Miller was eventually elevated to Cook, Third Class and assigned to the USS West Virginia stationed at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. Miller was doing laundry as a mess attendant aboard the West Virginia on December 7, 1941, when it was subjected to a surprise attack by Japanese forces. After hearing a loud and urgent summons to battle, Miller, who made his way from below deck to the ship’s bridge, saw Japanese fighter planes attacking US Naval forces, and the harbor already engulfed in flames. He ran to an anti-aircraft station, only to find it shattered by a Japanese torpedo. Miller then pulled a captain and several of his crew mates to safety under heavy enemy fire. After making sure that his fellow sailors were out of harm’s way, Miller returned to the bridge, secured an unattended 50-caliber anti-aircraft gun, and began firing at Japanese warplanes. Although he had no previous training in operating the weapon, by the end of the attack he managed to shoot down at least two, and perhaps as many as six, Japanese aircraft. “It wasn’t hard,” Miller recalled, “I just pulled the trigger and she worked fine.” Once Miller ran out of ammunition, he was ordered to abandon ship. Although Miller’s courage under fire was initially overlooked, the black press seized his story and pressured the Navy to recognize him. On May 27, 1942, Admiral Chester W. Nimitz honored him by awarding him the Navy Cross, the third highest medal in the Navy. The Navy then promoted Miller to Cook, third class and moved him from the laundry room to the galley. During the spring of 1943, Dorie Miller was assigned to the Liscome Bay and was still serving as a “messman” on the warship, despite his previous heroism, when the carrier was sunk in the Gilbert Islands (now the Republic of Kiribati) on November 24, 1943. At the time of his death Miller was 24. In addition to the Navy Cross, Miller received the Purple Heart, the American Defense Service Medal – Fleet Clasp, Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal, and the World War II Victory Medal. In 1973, the Knox-class frigate USS Miller was named for Doris “Dorie” Miller. In 1991, Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority dedicated a bronze commemorative plaque of Miller at the Miller Family Park, located on the US Naval Base in Pearl Harbor.

Morgan Hair Refining Cream Company that sold a line of hair care products. During the same period Morgan was working on other projects, including a breathing device that would protect firefighters against smoke inhalation. In 1914 he received a patent for the Morgan Safety Hood and formed the National Safety Device Company, generating interest in his invention through demonstrations at public safety exhibitions. It was used most notably on July 25, 1916 when he was asked to help rescue Cleveland Water Works miners trapped in a tunnel beneath Lake Erie. Morgan and his brother Frank, along with another volunteer, used the safety masks to descend into the tunnel and rescue several survivors. During the next decade Morgan continued to invent while publishing the Cleveland Call, a weekly African American newspaper that he established in 1916 and that in 1929 became the Cleveland Call and Post, which is still in publication today. He also was at work on other solutions to modern-day problems, including traffic safety after witnessing an accident between a horse carriage and an automobile. In 1923 he received a patent for the G.A. Morgan Safety System, an improvement on prior traffic signals that included a caution indicator for all traffic to stop simultaneously. Other inventions included a women’s hat fastener, a curling comb, and a cigarette extinguisher. Suffering from failing health in his later years, perhaps due to exposure to chemicals while testing his safety hood, Morgan died on July 27, 1963. His papers are in the archives of the Western Reserve Historical Society in Cleveland, Ohio.",

        "summary": "Born Chloe Anthony Wofford on February 18, 1931, in Lorain, Ohio to parents George and Ella Ramah Wofford, novelist Toni Morrison grew up in a working-class family. She received a B.A. from Howard University after majoring in English and minoring in the classics. Wofford earned an M.A. in English from Cornell University and then taught at Howard University and Texas Southern University, before entering the publishing world as an editor at Random House. She married (and later divorced) Harold Morrison and gave birth to sons Ford and Slade Kevin. Morrison taught at Yale, Bard College, Rutgers University and the State University of New York at Albany. She later held the Robert F. Goheen Professorship in the Humanities at Princeton University. Recognized internationally as a major American writer, Morrison was the author of eleven novels, including The Bluest Eye (1973), the story of a little black girl’s quest for identity and acceptance in a world that privileged whiteness; Sula (1973), which celebrates friendship between women and the complexity of black womanhood; Song of Solomon (1977), which follows its male protagonist, Milkman Dead, on his quest for cultural heritage; and Tar Baby (1981), which explores a love affair between a couple from radically different socio-economic backgrounds. Morrison’s early works received critical acclaim, including National Book Awards nominations and the National Book Critics’ Circle Award for Song of Solomon. Morrison’s fifth novel, Beloved (1987), a haunting story about the atrocities of slavery and a black slave mother’s effort to protect her children against its dehumanizing effect through infanticide, won the Pulitzer Prize and was instrumental in her receiving the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1993. In 2006, Beloved, made into a movie starring Oprah Winfrey, was named the greatest work of American fiction in the past twenty five years by The New York Times Book Review. In her subsequent novels Jazz (1992), Paradise (1998), and Love (2003), Morrison continued her exploration of such themes as friendships between women, quest for personal identity, the complexity of the black community, a celebration of African American history and culture, and the importance of love, the dominant theme in her work, to the human experience. Morrison has published a play, Dreaming Emmett (1985), a short story, “Recitative” (1982), a series of children’s stories (with her son Slade), a libretto, Margaret Garner, and several non-fiction works, including The Black Book (1974) and a collection of critical essays, Playing in the Dark: Whiteness and the Literary Imagination (1992). The recipient of numerous awards and honors, Morrison was named curator for an art exhibit, “Stranger at Home” (“étranger chez soi”) (2006), for the Louvre in Paris, France, where she read from her ninth novel, Mercy. Toni Morrison passed away on August 5, 2019, in a hospital in The Bronx, New York due to complications from pneumonia. She was 88 years old. She is survived by her son, Harold Ford Morrison, and three grandchildren.",

He was the son of sharecropper and Baptist minister Wallace Poole and his wife, Mariah. During his childhood in the racially segregated South, Poole received his basic education at a public school but soon dropped out to help his family earn a living in the fields. After his marriage to Clara Evans in 1919, he joined the “Great Migration” of African Americans to the North in 1923 which led him to Detroit, Michigan. Like many of his fellow migrants, Poole found a job in the automobile industry until the Depression forced his family to go on relief for two years. During his unemployment, Poole met Wallace Fard, the founder of the Nation of Islam who preached a gospel of black Islam and racial supremacy. Poole joined the organization in 1931, changed his name to Elijah Muhammad and soon became such a devoted disciple that Fard made him Chief Minister of Islam. When Fard left the United States, Elijah Muhammad rose to power. But it was not until 1946, when Muhammad had served his four-year prison sentence for preaching sedition and avoiding the draft during World War II, that he could build the Nation of Islam according to his beliefs. His doctrine included the legend of the tribe of Shabazz, the first black people on Earth who had been tricked out of their power by the evil scientist Yacub, the creator of the “white devils.” To throw off the yoke of white oppression, Muhammad told blacks, they had to follow Islam. His controversial beliefs met the criticism from other Islamic groups and many black civil rights leaders. Nonetheless the Nation attracted numerous converts including Malcolm Little who became Malcolm X. Eventually Malcolm X became as recognized a leader of the Nation as Elijah Muhammad, which may have created tension between the two men. When Malcolm learned of two paternity suits brought against Muhammad by his former secretaries, the alienation between the mentor and his follower led to his break with the Nation in 1964. Malcolm X was assassinated one year later by, as many believe, a direct order of Muhammad. After his prophecies of the Fall of America in the late 1960s proved to be wrong, Elijah Muhammad’s authority slowly began to disintegrate, paralleled by his declining physical condition. On February 25, 1975, Elijah Muhammad died in Chicago, Illinois. He was succeeded by his son Wallace, who led the Nation of Islam to a more Orthodox Islam.",

        "summary": "James Cleveland “Jesse” Owens is best known for his remarkable athletic performance at the 1936 Berlin Olympics where he won four gold medals. Owens was born near Oakville, Alabama, on September 12, 1913, the twelfth child of sharecroppers Henry Cleveland and Mary Emma Owens. Owens, the youngest child, was spared much of the difficult farm work because of his persistent pneumonia which nearly killed him twice in his young life. In 1922 Henry and Emma Owens moved north to Cleveland, Ohio. The move immediately exposed young Owens to regular schooling and participation in athletics. During his senior year at East Technical High School Owens ran the 100-yard sprint in 9.4 seconds, tying the national record at the time and garnering his first national attention. After completing high school in 1933 Owens attended Ohio State University at a time when the institution offered no athletic scholarships. He worked part-time to support himself through college as he continued to set records on the track field. On May 25, 1935 during the National Intercollegiate Championship at Ann Arbor, Michigan Owens set four new world records in the 100 yard sprint, the long jump, the 220 yard sprint, and the 220 yard low hurdles. On July 5, 1935 Owens married Minnie Ruth Solomon in the living room of her parents’ Cleveland home. The couple had three girls, Gloria, Beverly, and Marlene. As 1936 began Owens was the favorite to make the US Olympic team where he joined Ralph Metcalfe, the previous record holder in the 100 yard sprint. The Olympic Games were scheduled for Berlin and Adolf Hitler used the setting to promote Nazi theories of Aryan supremacy and the reemergence of Germany on the world political scene. At the beginning of the games, German athletes dominated their competitors before home crowds numbering over 100,000. Most observers believed the Germans would win gold medals in most major track and field events. Owens surprised them by winning four gold medals in the 100 meter sprint, the long jump, the 200 meter sprint, and the 4 x 100 meter relay team. Jesse Owens returned to a ticker-tape parade down Fifth Avenue but soon afterwards drifted into obscurity. When he attempted to capitalize on his success right after the Games by taking lucrative commercial offers, US athletic official stripped him of his amateur status. Soon afterwards the commercial offers disappeared as well. He failed to make a living as a sports promoter, performed in vaudeville shows, ran a dry cleaning business, and eventually filed for bankruptcy. In 1968 Owens was appointed to the US Olympic Committee (USOC) and immediately became controversial for criticizing the black power salute by African American sprinters Tommie Smith and John Carlos in the 1968 Summer Olympics. Owens reconsidered his position on the salute and the politics behind it in a 1972 autobiography called I Have Changed. Owens, who had retired to Phoenix, Arizona in the 1960s, spent the rest of his life as a champion for underprivileged children, building youth clubs nationally, and a community medical center in South Phoenix, an area heavily populated by African Americans, Mexican Americans, and working class people. A chain smoker, Jesse Owens died of lung cancer in Tucson, Arizona, on March 31, 1980.",

        "summary": "Revered as one of the most influential people of the twentieth century, Rosa Parks is best known for her role in the Montgomery Bus Boycott in 1956. Parks was born on February 4, 1913, to Leona and James McCauley in Tuskegee, Alabama. Leona worked as a teacher and James as a carpenter. Parks was schooled by her mother until the age of eleven when she moved to Montgomery with an aunt and started attending the Montgomery Industrial School for girls. She even took a job as a janitor to support her private school education. Though Parks began to attend Alabama State Teacher’s College High School, she dropped out to care for ill family members. After marrying barber and local political activist Raymond Parks in 1931, she became an active member of Montgomery’s NAACP, where she served as youth director and later as the secretary. She also participated in the organization’s voter registration drives. Parks became an advocate of desegregation and took pride in being a member of the organization that won the Brown v. Board of Education case. On December 1, 1955, following the end of her shift as a seamstress for the Montgomery Fair department store, Parks boarded the Cleveland Avenue city bus. As passengers boarded the bus, Parks and other African American riders were asked to give up their seats once the “whites only” section had filled. Parks refused. Like other advocates of desegregation, Parks placed herself in danger by refusing to follow Montgomery’s segregation laws. She was arrested and received a $14 fine. This was Parks’s second encounter with the bus driver James Blake (he had kicked Parks off a bus many years prior to this incident). Parks called local NAACP president E.D. Nixon, and informed him of her arrest. Within hours, the Women’s Political Council (WPC)—which was formed in 1946 to address the grievances of black bus patrons in Montgomery—sprang into action. The WPC printed flyers and brochures, phoned potential supporters, and created carpools, marking the beginning of the 381-day Montgomery Bus Boycott. After a long protest, the US Supreme Court declared bus segregation unconstitutional in 1957. Following the boycott, Parks moved to Detroit, Michigan with her husband and worked as a seamstress before taking a job as an assistant to Detroit Congressman John Conyers. In 1987, she founded the Rosa and Raymond Parks Institute for Self-Development, which teaches students about the Civil Rights Movement and encourages them to strive for success. Parks received numerous honors, including over 40 honorary degrees, the Medal of Freedom, the Congressional Gold Medal of Honor, and two NAACP image awards. The state of Michigan honors Parks each February 4 on Rosa Parks Day. Troy State University in Alabama honored Parks by constructing a museum and library that bears her name. The Henry Ford Museum in Michigan also preserved Parks’ legacy by purchasing the Cleveland Avenue bus she rode on December 1, 1955. In addition to authoring several books about her story, in 2002, Parks teamed up with CBS to produce a biographical film titled “The Rosa Parks Story.” On October 5, 2005, Rosa Parks passed away in Detroit. She was 92 years old. Later that month she became one of only 30 Americans and the first woman to lie in honor in the Capitol Rotunda. In 2013, her statue was added to Statuary Hall in the same building. She was the first African American woman so honored.",

Young Powell grew up in New York City, New York since his father, a Baptist preacher, became pastor of the historic Abyssinian Baptist Church in midtown Manhattan in 1908, shortly after Powell was born. During the 1920s, the church and the Powell family relocated uptown to Harlem. Adam Clayton Powell, Jr. was educated in the New York City school system. He earned a bachelor’s degree in 1930 from Colgate University and then a master’s in religious education from Columbia University in 1932. During the Great Depression, Powell developed a reputation as a fearless Harlem community activist. He successfully organized and led peaceful boycotts to force white businesses in Harlem to hire blacks for management and professional positions. He was also an outspoken advocate for fair and affordable housing. In 1933, Powell married nightclub performer Isabel Washington. On November 1, 1937, Powell succeeded his father as pastor of Abyssinian Baptist Church in Harlem. During his early tenure as pastor, Powell substantially increased the size of the congregation through continued community outreach and inspired preaching. As pastor of Abyssinian, he also continued his activism. Powell organized and led a successful protest to increase the number of blacks employed at the 1939 New York World’s Fair. Two years later, he focused on discrimination in the New York City transportation system, initiating a boycott that forced city officials to hire hundreds of blacks to drive bus routes in Harlem for the first time. In 1941, Powell was elected on the Democratic ticket as New York City’s first black city council member. After serving on the council for three years, Powell in 1944 adopted a progressive civil rights platform centered on fair employment in his successful campaign to serve in the House of Representatives, representing Harlem’s 22nd Congressional district. When Powell took office in 1945, he became the first black Congressman from New York State. At that time he divorced Isabelle and married world renowned musician and actress Hazel Scott. During their union, they had one child, Adam Clayton Powell, III in 1946. Powell became the first black Chairman of the prestigious and powerful Labor and Education Committee in 1961. During that decade he emerged as a staunch supporter of the legislative agendas of Presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson. Powell’s committee passed dozens of social and economic measures as part of President Johnson’s Great Society program, including legislation that improved education and training for the deaf, provided college student loans and public school lunches, and increased the minimum wage. After divorcing Scott in 1961, Powell married a third time to Yvette Flores. Their marriage produced a son, Adam Clayton Powell IV. By the late 1960s legal challenges, personal scandal, and challenges to his senority in Congress led to his declining influence. In June 1970, Charles Rangel defeated Powell in the Democratic primary. After losing his bid to return to office, Powell resigned as pastor of Abyssinian Baptist Church and retired to the Island of Bimini in the Bahamas. On April 4, 1972, Powell died at the age of 63 of complications from prostate cancer at Jackson Memorial Hospital in Miami, Florida. Following his death, New York City officials renamed Seventh Avenue in Harlem Adam Clayton Powell, Jr. Boulevard. In 1983 the Harlem State Office Building was renamed the Adam Clayton Powell Jr. State Office Building. The New York City Board of Education has also named two public schools after him.",

Colin Powell was born on April 5, 1937, in the Bronx, New York to Jamaican immigrant parents. He attended public schools in the Hunts Point area of South Bronx and was eventually accepted to New York University. Lacking the funds to attend this private university, Powell instead enrolled at the City University of New York, where he joined the Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC), graduating with a degree in geology and as a Second Lieutenant in the Infantry. Taking his first post abroad in West Germany, Powell soon realized that the advanced racial integration of the armed forces would yield tremendous upward opportunities, and he decided to make a career in the army. Powell served two tours of duty in Vietnam and received eleven medals for exemplary service. In 1971, he took advantage of the Army’s college funding programs, earning a master’s degree from George Washington University. While at George Washington University, he received a coveted White House fellowship. In 1972, Powell was appointed Battalion Commander of the elite 101st Airborne in South Korea. By 1979, he was a Brigadier General and was Deputy Commander at Fort Leavenworth. Between 1983 and 1986, Powell, then a Three-Star General, commanded the Fifth Corps, U.S. Army, in Frankfurt, Germany. In 1987, at the age of 49, General Colin Powell was named National Security Advisor in the Ronald Reagan administration. In 1989, newly elected President George H.W. Bush appointed Powell as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. During his tenure Powell oversaw U.S. military actions in Panama, the Philippines and Operation Desert Storm. Powell was both the youngest person, and once again first African American, to hold this position. He served under both the Bush and Clinton Administrations until his retirement in 1993 from military service after thirty-five years. Because of his immense popularity, many assumed Powell would enter politics after retirement, but he instead devoted his time to family, writing, and public speaking. He ultimately returned to the White House in 2001 as the newly appointed Secretary of State by President George W. Bush, once again as the first African American to hold the post. Colin Powell resigned as Secretary of State in 2005. Despite numerous requests from both parties to join the political circles and run for political office, Powell has chosen to remain in private life. He now focuses his attention in several areas of the private sector including serving on the Board of Trustees at Howard University, the Board of Directors of the United Negro College Fund, the Board of Directors of the Boys and Girls Club, and as Chairman of the Eisenhower Fellowship Program.",

APRI’s mission statement includes encouraging black involvement in unions and working with the labor movement on key sociopolitical issues such as employment, education, healthcare, and housing. Soon after its founding, and throughout the decades since, APRI showed solidarity for various unions by supporting demonstrations such as the Memphis, Tennessee, sanitation workers’ strike in 1968, the General Electric strikers in 1969, the Mississippi catfish workers in the 1980s, and the Institute allied with Greyhound and Eastern Airlines workers picketing in the 1990s. APRI holds several annual events for local communities and for its members. Individual chapters organize annual banquets, which started in the 1970s for most cities. The banquets award members of the local church community, legislature, and labor unions for impactful work, and proceeds go to the APRI Education Committee’s Scholarship Fund. The National Education Conference for all APRI chapters began in 1969, gathering to discuss innovations and solutions for empowering black youth and to push for school funding locally and federally. The Institute’s Trade Unions Intern Program supports young people desiring to enter apprenticeships in various industries. APRI chapters invest much of their energies in voter education and participation, through their Get Out the Vote program. Chapters set up voter registration events, distribute voter education literature, and, although a non-partisan organization, invite those running for office to forums where the community can ask the candidates about their platforms. At the 25th Annual National Conference, then-president of APRI Norman Hill stated that the founders “…recognized that the freedom struggle… would no longer be [just through] demonstrations…[but] to engage in political action to secure economic justice through a fundamental redistribution of wealth in America.” APRI is a senior constituency group of the AFL-CIO.

He served for a year before leaving to become the president of a historically Black college. Revels died on January 16, 1901, in Aberdeen, Mississippi. Hiram Rhodes Revels was born in Fayetteville, North Carolina, on September 27, 1827. Despite being born in the South in a time of widespread slavery, Revels was a member of a free family. He and his brother both apprenticed as barbers. Revels' brother subsequently owned his own barbershop. Upon his brother's death, Revels inherited and ran the shop before leaving North Carolina to study at seminaries in Indiana and Ohio. In 1845, he was ordained as a minister in the African Methodist Episcopal Church, working as an itinerant preacher. Revels participated in the Civil War, organizing two Black regiments for the Union Army. He also fought for the Union at the Battle of Vicksburg. After the war, he settled in Natchez, Mississippi, with his wife and daughters, and continued his career in the clergy. He quickly grew to be a respected member of the community, known for his keen intelligence and oratorical skills. Although he had no previous government experience, Revels garnered enough community support to win election to the position of alderman in 1868, during the first phase of Reconstruction. He then served briefly in the Mississippi State Senate. In 1870, the state congress selected Revels to fill a vacant seat in the United States Senate. Debate surrounding his eligibility hinged on the 1857 Dred Scott decision, which precluded African American citizenship. The decision was effectively reversed by the ratification of the 14th Amendment after the Civil War. Democrats argued that Revels did not meet the nine-year citizenship requirement to hold congressional office given his ineligibility for citizenship through the war years. Ultimately, Revels and his Republican allies prevailed by citing Revels's mixed-race background, and Revels became the first African American to serve in the United States Senate. His appointment was particularly symbolic in that the seat he occupied had previously belonged to Jefferson Davis, the president of the Confederacy. During his time in Washington, the press praised Revels for his well-crafted speeches and diplomatic approach to a tense congressional environment. His signature issue was civil rights, including the integration of schools and equal opportunities for Black workers. Revels urged a moderate view on the restoration of Confederate citizenship. While the Radical Republicans in Congress called for harsh punishments to be meted out to Civil War rebels, Senator Revels took a milder view. He argued for the immediate restoration of citizenship to former Confederates, along with the secure enfranchisement, education and employment eligibility of African Americans. Revels resigned from the Senate after a year to accept the presidency of Alcorn Agricultural and Mechanical College, located in Claiborne County, Mississippi. He also served as an instructor in philosophy. This position at the historically Black Alcorn allowed Revels to directly participate in the intellectual enrichment of African Americans—a cause for which he had fought while serving in the Senate. In addition to his administrative and teaching roles, Revels remained involved with the Methodist Church, continuing to preach publicly until the end of his life. Revels died on January 16, 1901, while attending a meeting of Methodist ministers in Aberdeen, Mississippi.",

        "occupation": "Muscian, Actor, Athlete",
        "summary": "Paul Robeson is best known as a world famous athlete, singer, actor, and advocate for the human rights of people throughout the world. Over the course of his career Robeson combined all of these activities into a lifelong quest for racial justice. He used his deep baritone voice to communicate the problems and progress associated with black culture and community, and to assist the labor and social movements of his time. He sang for multiracial and multiethnic peace and justice in twenty-five languages throughout the United States, Europe, and Africa. Robeson was born in Princeton, New Jersey on April 9, 1898, to Reverend William Drew Robeson, the pastor of Princeton’s Witherspoon Street Presbyterian Church, and Maria Louisa Bustill Robeson. His mother was from a prominent local mixed-race family and his father was a former slave who escaped from a plantation before the Civil War. Robeson was the youngest of four children. Robeson’s mother died when he was six and his father struggled to care for the two youngest children. By 1912 the family had moved to Somerville, New Jersey where the young Robeson already was a standout athlete and stage performer. He also preached in his father’s church. In 1915 Robeson became the third African American student to enroll at Rutgers University. There he became an All-American Football player, received a Phi Beta Kappa key for his scholarship, and graduated as class valedictorian. Robeson entered the New York University Law School in 1919 and while there supported himself by serving as the assistant football coach at Lincoln University where he joined Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity. Robeson left New York University Law School in 1920, moved to Harlem, and transferred to Columbia University Law School. He graduated from that institution in 1923 while playing professional football for the Akron Pros coached by Fritz Pollard. Robeson ended his professional football career in 1922. After getting a J.D., he briefly practiced law but decided to focus his career on the stage and screen. In December 1923 he landed the lead role of Jim in Eugene O’Neill’s play, All Gods Chillun Got Wings. Over the next thirty years Robeson built a career in theater and music which he also saw as a way to battle racism. He starred in eleven films, including Body and Soul (1924), Jericho (1937), and Proud Valley (1939). In London, Robeson rose to international fame for his theatrical role in Othello (1944). In 1933 Robeson made film history by becoming the first African American to star in a major studio production, The Emperor Jones. He also took on controversial role such as Bosambo in Sanders of the River (1935). The film made him an international star but it also created a backlash because of its stereotypical portrayal of Africans. From that point, Robeson vowed to appear on screen and stage only in what he considered positive roles. Around this time, Robeson began a decades-long association with the Soviet Union which he visited for the first time in 1934. While never admitting whether he joined the Communist Party, he continued to promote socialism and the Soviet Union even during the height of the Red Scare in the United States. With Max Yergan, Benjamin Davis, Jr., and Revels Cayton, he became one of the most consistent voices on the American Left. During the 1940s Robeson challenged U.S. President Harry Truman to support an anti-lynching law, protested the growing Cold War, and worked tirelessly for friendship and respect between the U.S. and the USSR. In 1945, Robeson openly questioned why blacks should fight in the army of a government that tolerated racism. Because of his outspokenness, he was accused by the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) of being a Communist. The allegation almost destroyed his career. In 1950, the U.S. rescinded Robeson’s passport, leading him to an eight-year battle to regain it and his ability to travel abroad. During those years, Robeson studied Chinese, met with Albert Einstein to discuss the prospects for world peace, published his autobiography, Here I Stand, and sang at Carnegie Hall in New York City, New York. In 1952 and 1953, he held two celebrated concerts at Peace Arch Park on the USA-Canadian border just north of Bellingham, Washington, singing to upwards of 40,000 people in both countries. Robeson made a brief comeback as a stage performer in the late 1950s and early 1960s. He also became involved in the growing civil rights movement in the U.S. during that period but his failing health stymied both his stage career and his political activism. After suffering from double pneumonia and a kidney blockage in 1965 he permanently retired from public life and lived in seclusion in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Robeson died in that city on January 23, 1976 following complications from a stroke. He was 77.",

        "summary": "When Jack Roosevelt (Jackie) Robinson took the field on April 15, 1947 wearing a Brooklyn Dodgers uniform, he became the first African American in over fifty years to play on a major league baseball team. In the process, he broke through baseball’s color line that had relegated African American players to the segregated Negro Leagues. Jack Roosevelt Robinson, the youngest of five children, was born in Cairo, Georgia on January 31, 1919 to sharecroppers Jerry and Mallie Robinson. When Jack was a year old his father deserted the family, and Mallie Robinson relocated her family to Pasadena, California where Jack grew up. Robinson’s athletic ability was apparent from an early age. In high school he participated in five sports: basketball, football, baseball, tennis and track. He continued to play multiple sports at Pasadena Junior College, where he graduated in 1939, and then at the University of Southern California, Los Angeles (UCLA). While at UCLA, Robinson became the first athlete to earn varsity letters in four sports. Despite his athletic accomplishments, Robinson believed that his chances of playing on any major league sports team after graduation were slim, given the racism of the era, and in 1941 he left college just shy of graduation to take a job as an assistant athletic director with the National Youth Administration in Atascadero, California. The position, however, was short-lived as government funding for the job ended the following year. In 1942, Robinson was drafted into a segregated Army unit where he served two years. He was admitted into Officer Candidate School and became a second lieutenant in 1943, although his service was marred when he was court-martialed for refusing a civilian bus driver’s order to move to the “back of the bus” during a trip back to the base. After a brief trial, he received an honorable discharge in 1944. The incident was played out in a 1990 movie, The Court-Martial of Jackie Robinson. Robinson then joined the Kansas City Monarchs, a Negro League team. In August of 1944 Robinson was still with the Monarchs when Branch Rickey approached him about playing for the Dodger’s organization. Robinson spent the 1946 season with the Dodger’s farm team, the Montreal Royals. Also that year he married his college sweetheart, Rachel Isum. The couple had three children, Jackie Jr. (1946), Sharon (1950), and David (1952). In 1947 Robinson took the field for the Brooklyn Dodgers becoming the first African American in the 20th century to play for a major league baseball team. At the end of his first season with the Dodgers, Robinson was named National League Rookie of the year. He had 12 home runs, a league-leading 29 steals, and a .297 batting average. In 1949 Robinson was selected as the National League’s Most Valuable Player (MVP). He also won the batting title with a .342 average. In ten seasons with the Dodgers, Robinson played in six World Series games including the Dodgers’ 1955 World Championship. He played in six consecutive All-Star Games, from 1949 to 1954, and retired at the end of the 1956 season. In 1962, his first year of eligibility, Robinson was inducted in the National Baseball Hall of Fame. In retirement, Robinson was an active participant in the struggle for civil rights, working with Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and with the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). He also wrote for The New York Post and The Amsterdam News. Jackie Robinson died of a heart attack on October 24, 1972 at his home in Stamford, Connecticut. He was 53. On March 26, 1984, Robinson was posthumously awarded the nation’s highest civilian honor, the Medal of Freedom, by President Ronald Reagan. In 1996 the U.S. Congress and President Clinton authorized a coin to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of Robinson’s 1947 entry into major league baseball. In 1997 the U.S. Post Office issued a stamp in his honor, and on the 50th anniversary of the date that Robinson broke major league baseball’s color barrier, Major League Baseball retired Robinson’s number 42.",

Centuries before scholars began debating such issues as “hegemony” and “the social construction of race,” Russwurm understood how the powerful used media to create and perpetuate destructive stereotypes of the powerless. He set out to challenge this practice, via a brand new form of media: African American journalism. Although he helped to change the terms of debate on race in America, Russwurm was not a native of America. Born in Jamaica on October 1, 1799, he moved to Quebec, Canada as a child and then to Maine, where he attended Bowdoin College and wrote term papers on Toussaint L‘Ouverture, fiery leader of the Haitian Revolution. In 1826 Russwurm became only the second African American in the U.S. to earn a college degree. His graduation speech focused on the Haitian Revolution. The next year he moved to New York, where he met Samuel Cornish, an African American Presbyterian minister and editor. On March 16, 1827, Cornish and Russwurm published the first issue of Freedom’s Journal. White publishers—specifically Mordecai Noah of the New York Enquirer—had long denigrated and attacked free blacks. Freedom’s Journal took direct aim at them. “We wish to plead our own case,” the editors wrote. “Too long have others spoken for us. Too long has the publick been deceived by misrepresentation in things which concern us dearly.” The paper was strongly abolitionist, and it also sought to give African Americans pride in their communities. As such it included mini-biographies, poetry, sermons and birth, death and marriage announcements. In September 1827, Russwurm assumed editorial control of the paper, but his tenure lasted only until early 1829. Frustrated over the seeming impossibility of ending slavery, he decided to relocate to Liberia, established in 1819 by the American Colonization Society. Russwurm spent the next 22 years learning African languages and actively participating in politics and journalism. He died in Liberia in 1851. At the time of his death, nearly 30 African American newspapers existed in the United States, all devoted to ending slavery.",

After being sold to the Deep South Singleton escaped to Canada, but it was not long before he moved to Detroit, Michigan where he operated a boarding house where fugitive slaves were often housed. After the end of the Civil War, Singleton moved back to Nashville to work as a carpenter. Singleton was convinced that the key to salvation for blacks was farm ownership, and that it was his god-given duty to remove blacks from the south. Although he first attempted to acquire land in Tennessee in the late 1860s, by 1871 Singleton and his associates had turned their eyes to Kansas and in 1878 Singleton led his first emigrants, a party of two hundred settlers, to Kansas. Between 1877 and 1879 Singleton had, through the Edgefield Real Estate and Homestead Association which he had formed, steered more than 20,000 migrants to Kansas. For this work Singleton has been accredited as “The Father of the Exodus,” and although it is not entirely true that he was “the whole cause of the Kansas immigration” as he claimed, Singleton is without a doubt a leading contributor. Singleton did not end his work here though. In 1883-84 he sensed a renewed interest in migration and so he attempted to encourage blacks to emigrate to the island of Cyprus which he thought would eventually become an Afro-American nation. This venture was not successful, and so in 1885 Singleton formed the United Trans-Atlantic Society in order to bring African Americans back to their “Fatherland” of Africa. However, this group too was not very successful, and this was largely the end of his career. Singleton moved to Kansas City, Missouri in the 1880s and lived the rest of his life there.

        "summary": "Mary Church Terrell, a writer, suffragist, educator, and activist, co-founded the National Association of Colored Women and served as the organization’s first president. Known as “Mollie” to her family, Church who was born in Memphis, Tennessee in 1863, lived a life of privilege due to the economic success of her parents, both former slaves. Her mother, Louisa Ayres Church, owned a hair salon, while her father, Robert Reed Church, was the first black millionaire in the South due to his business and real estate dealings. Church’s parents divorced when she and her brother were young, and her father remarried. Church left her hometown of Memphis, Tennessee, at an early age to enroll at the elementary school at the Antioch College laboratory school in Ohio. She remained in Ohio to attend both Oberlin Academy and Oberlin College, where she earned a Bachelor of Arts in Classical Languages in 1884. She earned a master’s degree from Oberlin four years later. Although her father disapproved of her working, Church became a teacher after graduating from Oberlin. She taught at Wilberforce College in Ohio before moving to Washington, D.C. in 1887 to join the faculty at M Street Colored High School, which later became Dunbar High School. While in Washington, she met fellow teacher Anna Julia Cooper, as well as the man she would marry, Robert Heberton Terrell, chairman of the school’s language department. Since married women could not work as teachers in Washington, D.C., she resigned when they wed in 1891. One year after her wedding, tragic news from her hometown motivated Terrell to become a social activist. In 1892, she learned that Thomas Moss, a close friend from Memphis, had been lynched. After Terrell’s and Frederick Douglass’s appeals to President Benjamin Harrison failed to produce a public condemnation of lynching, she formed the Colored Women’s League in Washington to address social problems facing black communities. Four years later, Terrell helped create the National Association of Colored Women (NACW), and became its first president. The NACW adopted the motto, “Lifting As We Climb,” and promoted racial uplift through education and community activism. During her tenure as president of the NACW, from 1896 to 1901, Terrell became a well-known speaker and writer in the United States and overseas. She supported the women’s suffrage movement, even as segregationists tried to exclude black women from the cause. In 1898 and 1900, Terrell attended the biennial meetings of the National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA), where she stressed that African Americans had to confront sexual and racial barriers. During a visit to Germany in 1904, she presented a speech to the International Council of Women entirely in German. Terrell lent her support to several political causes. An enthusiastic member of the Republican Party, she worked as president of the Women’s Republican League in Washington, D.C. She also accepted an appointment from the Republican Party to direct a program for black women in the eastern United States. At the same time, Terrell served on Washington’s Board of Education in an unpaid position from 1895 to 1901, and again from 1906 to 1911. In 1909, Terrell signed the charter that established the National Association for the Advancement for Colored People (NAACP). In addition to founding and chairing numerous organizations, Terrell also used her writing to advance her social and political interests. Her scholarly articles, poems, and short stories about race and gender appeared in numerous journals and magazines. In 1940, she wrote her autobiography, A Colored Woman in a White World, which details her own battles with gender and racial discrimination in the United States. After World War II, Terrell joined the burgeoning efforts to end legal segregation in Washington, D.C. She lived to see the desegregation of eating facilities in the capital city, which occurred in 1953. One year later, the Supreme Court ruled that segregation in public schools was unconstitutional. Mary Church Terrell died in Highland Beach, Maryland, on July 24, 1954 slightly more than two months after the decision was handed down. She was 90.",

        "summary": "William Monroe Trotter was a major civil rights activist in the early twentieth century, known primarily for launching the first major challenge to the political dominance of Tuskegee Institute founder Booker T. Washington and as an inspiration for the formation of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). Trotter was also the founder of the Boston Guardian (1901), the National Negro Suffrage League (1905), the Niagara Movement (1905), and the Negro American Political League (1908). William Trotter was born on April 7, 1872, in Chillicothe, Ohio. His family moved to Boston, Massachusetts in 1879. At a young age, he was exposed to education and equal rights activism through his father James, a rare black Democrat that supported New York’s Grover Cleveland in his successful bid for president in 1884. Two years later, James Trotter was appointed Recorder of Deeds for Washington by President Cleveland, making him the highest-ranking black federal official at the time. William Trotter’s mother was Virginia Isaac Trotter. Trotter excelled academically in predominantly white schools in Boston and entered Harvard College in 1891. Four years later, he earned his bachelor’s degree in international banking with honors (magna cum laude) while becoming Harvard’s first black Phi Beta Kappa member. A year later, he received an M.A. degree from Harvard in finance. Restricted from working as a banker because of his race, Trotter worked in his father’s real estate firm. In 1899, he married equal rights activist Geraldine L. Pindell, who in 1901 became the society editor for the Boston Guardian. Mrs. Trotter died in the 1918 flu pandemic, leaving Trotter a widower at the age of 46. Trotter is best known for his strident opposition to the racially conciliatory policies advocated by Booker T. Washington and his call for a renewed emphasis on liberal arts education in contrast to Washington’s promotion of industrial training. Trotter’s public challenges of Washington’s policies began in 1901 with his founding of the Boston Guardian and the Boston Literary and Historical Association, a forum designed to attract potential opponents of Washington including, most notably, W.E.B. DuBois. Trotter’s first personal encounter with Washington came in 1903 when he interrupted the Tuskegee founder’s address to a National Negro Business League meeting at a Boston’s African Methodist Episcopal (AME) Zion church. Trotter referred to Washington as “the Great Traitor” and “Benedict Arnold” and was subsequently arrested and convicted for disorderly conduct. Trotter spent thirty days in jail, and some civil rights leaders believed that Trotter’s arrest had been orchestrated by supporters of Washington. Trotter quickly became the national symbol of opposition to the “Tuskegee Machine,” a network of institutions and surrogates that supported Booker T. Washington’s ideology. In July 1905, twenty-nine opponents of Washington, including Trotter and W.E.B. DuBois, met in Niagara Falls, Canada to form the Niagara Movement, the first organization to challenge Washington’s power, and the first black-oriented civil rights organization formed in the twentieth century. During the meeting, this group drew up a manifesto, demanding voting rights for African Americans, an end to racial segregation and discrimination, and better health care, housing, and schools for the nation’s black population. In 1908, Trotter left the organization in opposition to women joining and the growing prominence of W.E. B. DuBois. One year later, Trotter rejoined several Niagara co-founders in helping to establish the NAACP, even though he refused to join the Association because he felt it was compromised by white leadership and financial support. As an alternative, he revived the National Equal Rights League. Trotter’s outspoken activism also extended to his direct denouncements of President Theodore Roosevelt for discharging three companies of the all-Black 25th United States Infantry after the Brownsville Riot in Texas (1906), and publicly confronting President Woodrow Wilson in 1914 after the new president imposed racial segregation on federal employees for the first time. Beginning in 1915, Trotter led Boston protests against the racist motion picture, The Birth of a Nation. Trotter’s quest for social justice included his urging a federal commitment to equal rights before black soldiers participated in the United States’ World War I war effort.

        "summary": "Sojourner Truth, an abolitionist, women’s rights activist, emancipated slave and itinerant evangelist, became arguably the most well-known 19th Century African American woman. Born around 1791, Isabella (her birth name) was the daughter of James and Betsey, slaves of Colonel Ardinburgh Hurley, Ulster County, New York. From a young age, she was bought and sold several times by slaveowners in New York. She married an enslaved man named Thomas, and together they had five children. On July 4, 1827, the New York State Legislature emancipated Isabella, yet her owners at the time, the Dumonts, would not comply because they claimed she still owed them work. One morning before dawn, with a baby in her arms, she walked away from the Dumonts and took refuge with an abolitionist family who lived five miles away. During this time, she experienced a religious conversion and became active in the nearby Methodist church. Eventually, she moved with her son, Peter, to New York City, where she worked as a live-in domestic. She became involved in a religious cult known as the Kingdom, whose leader, Matthias, beat her and assigned her the heaviest workload. The turning point in Isabella’s life came on June 1, 1843, when at the age of 52 she adopted a new name, Sojourner Truth, and headed east for the purpose of “exhorting the people to embrace Jesus, and refrain from sin.” For several years, she preached at camp meetings and lived in a utopian community, the Northampton Association for Education and Industry, which devoted itself to transcending class, race, and gender distinctions. Even though the community lasted less than five years, many reform-minded influential people visited Northampton, including abolitionist leaders Frederick Douglass and William Lloyd Garrison. Through these connections, she began to speak at public events on behalf of abolition and women’s rights. In 1851, she gave her famous “Ain’t I A Woman” speech at a Women’s Rights Convention in Akron, Ohio. In 1857, Truth bought a house with the help of friends in Harmonia, a small Spiritualist community near Battle Creek, Michigan. She supported herself through speaking engagements and selling photographs of herself as well as her book, Narrative of Sojourner Truth, written by an amanuensis, since she was illiterate. When the Civil War began, Truth threw her energy into soliciting food and clothing for the volunteer regiments of black Union soldiers. Then the plight of freed slaves caught her attention, many of whom were living in refugee camps in the nation’s capital. During the War 67-year-old Truth made a round-trip journey from Battle Creek to Washington, D.C. to meet with President Abraham Lincoln about the condition of the freed slaves in Washington and across the nation. With the help of Lucy Coleman, a white Massachusetts abolitionist, and Elizabeth Hobbs Keckley, the African American dressmaker for Mrs. Lincoln, Truth finally had an appointment with President Lincoln on October 29, 1864. After the Civil War Truth championed the idea of a colony for freed slaves in the American West where they would have a chance to become self-supporting and self-reliant. She garnered numerous signatures for her petition urging the Federal government to provide land for this endeavor. Although she presented the petition to President Ulysses S. Grant, her dream never materialized. Nevertheless, when a large migration of freed southern slaves made their way west in the fall of 1879, despite her advanced age, Truth traveled to Kansas to help them get settled. Sojourner Truth died in Battle Creek, Michigan on November 26, 1883. She was 92.",

Born enslaved in 1821 and raised in Dorchester County, Maryland to Benjamin and Harriett Greene Ross, Harriett was both a field hand and a domestic servant. As a young girl, she suffered a lifelong injury after her master threw a piece of iron at her, which struck her in the head. Throughout her life, Harriett suffered bouts of narcoleptic seizures. In 1844, she married a free black man, John Tubman. She escaped in 1849 in order to avoid being sold into the Deep South. Her husband refused to go with her. Several months later, when she returned to get him, she learned he had taken another wife. He died shortly after the end of the Civil War. Harriett later married Nelson Davis. Upon her escape, Tubman trekked northward to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania where, like most working class free black women, she found employment as a washer woman and domestic servant. At the same time, she participated in the Underground Railroad, and as a result, developed networks with both black and white abolitionists. During the Civil War Tubman served as a spy for the Union Army. On June 2, 1863, however, Tubman, under the command of Union Colonel James Montgomery, led 150 black Union soldiers in the Combahee River Raid in South Carolina. This was the only Civil War military engagement where a woman was the commander. Tubman who was already aware of vital information about the location of Confederate torpedoes planted along the river, led Union gunboats to specific areas where fugitive slaves were hiding and waiting to be rescued. Eventually 750 people were liberated from slavery. Some of the men eventually joined the First South Carolina Volunteers, the military regiment established for former slaves in coastal South Carolina in 1862. The Combahee River Raid was a major military and psychological blow to the Confederate cause. After the end of the Civil War Tubman settled in Washington, D.C. and participated in the emerging national suffrage movement. In 1911, two years before she died, she attended a meeting of the suffrage club in Geneva, New York, where a white woman asked her: “Do you really believe that women should vote?” Tubman reportedly replied, “I suffered enough to believe it.” Harriet Ross Tubman died of pneumonia on March 10, 1913 in Auburn, New York. She was believed to be 92 at the time of her death.",

Carmichael was born in 1941 in Port of Spain, Trinidad. His family moved to New York City, New York when he was eleven. He showed promise as a young student and was accepted into the mostly white Bronx High School of Science in 1956. He attended Howard University and joined the newly formed Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) in 1960. He participated in SNCC sit-ins and Freedom Rides throughout the Deep South, and when SNCC turned its attention to voter registration, Carmichael led the campaign that established the Lowndes County Freedom Organization, a symbolic forerunner to the Black Panther Party. In 1964, Carmichael graduated from Howard and, along with other young SNCC activists, became increasingly frustrated with the movement’s reliance on white liberals and its advocacy of non-violent reform, especially in the wake of the Democratic Party’s betrayal of the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party. In May 1965, Carmichael was elected to replace John Lewis as SNCC chairman, formalizing the shift in SNCC’s ideology. During a 1966 march in Mississippi, Carmichael first proclaimed “Black Power.” The slogan, and Carmichael’s subsequent efforts to both define it and put it into practice, turned him into a media celebrity and a lightning rod for white criticism and government repression. “Black Power” fragmented the liberal civil rights coalition of the 1950s and early 1960s but inspired subsequent groups such as the Black Panther Party, which, despite ideological disagreements, named Carmichael as its Honorary Prime Minister in 1968. Carmichael spent the last decades of his life abroad, denouncing U.S. racism and imperialism while working to build the All African Peoples Revolutionary Party. He changed his name to Kwame Ture in 1968, in honor of his friends and political allies, Pan-African leaders Sekou Touré and Kwame Nkrumah.

        "summary": "Black Nationalist, repatriationist, and minister, Henry M. Turner was 31 years old at the time of the Emancipation. Turner was born in 1834 in Newberry Courthouse, South Carolina to free black parents Sarah Greer and Hardy Turner. The self-taught Turner by the age of fifteen worked as a janitor at a law firm in Abbeville, South Carolina. The firm’s lawyers noted his abilities and helped with his education. However, Turner was attracted to the church and after being converted during a Methodist religious revival, decided to become a minister. He joined the African Methodist Episcopal (AME) Church and became a licensed minister in 1853 at the age of 19. Turner soon became an itinerant evangelist traveling as far as New Orleans, Louisiana. By 1856 he married Eliza Peacher, the daughter of a wealthy African American house builder in Columbia, South Carolina. The couple had fourteen children but only four of them survived into adulthood. In 1858 Turner entered Trinity College in Baltimore, Maryland where he studied Latin, Greek, Hebrew and theology. Two years later he became the pastor of the Union Bethel Church in Washington, D.C. Turner cultivated friendships with important Republican Congressional figures including Ohio Congressman Benjamin Wade, Pennsylvania Congressman Thaddeus Stevens, and Massachusetts Senator Charles Sumner. Turner had already become a national figure when in 1863 at the age of 29 he was appointed by President Lincoln to the position of Chaplain in the Union Army. Turner was attached to 1st Regiment, U.S. Colored Troops, making him the first African American chaplain in the history of the United States Army. After the Civil War, Turner returned to Georgia and quickly became active in Reconstruction-era politics. In 1867 he organized for the Republican Party in Georgia and the following year was elected a delegate to the Georgia State Constitutional Convention. In the same year he was also elected to the Georgia State Legislature. Although 27 African Americans were elected to that body, a coalition of white Democrats and Republicans declared the African American members disqualified and refused to seat them. President Ulysses S. Grant appointed Turner postmaster of Macon, Georgia. He was forced to resign in a few weeks under pressure from local Democrats. The U.S. Congress intervened and allowed Turner to reclaim his legislative seat in 1870 but he was not reelected in an election marred by fraud. Turner abandoned politics and moved to Savannah, Georgia where he served as pastor of St. Phillips AME Church. In 1876 he was appointed President of Morris Brown College in Atlanta. Four years later he was appointed a Bishop in the African Methodist Episcopal Church. Turner became the first AME Bishop to ordain a woman, Sarah Ann Hughes, to the office of deacon. He also wrote The Genius and Theory of Methodist Polity in 1885 as a guide to the policies and practices of the AME Church. By the late 1870s Turner became increasingly disillusioned with the inability of African Americans to achieve social justice in the United States. He proposed emigration back to Africa, an idea much discussed in the antebellum period but which all but disappeared during the Civil War and Reconstruction. By 1880 Turner had become one of the leading advocates of emigration, particularly to Liberia. He founded two newspapers, The Voice of Missions (1893-1900) and the Voice of the People (1901-1904) to promote emigration. Between 1895 and 1896, Turner organized two ship voyages to Liberia which carried over 500 emigrants to Liberia. Many of them returned disillusioned and thus undermined Turner’s emigrationist work. Independently of his emigrationist efforts, Turner also promoted the AME Church abroad. Between 1891 and 1898 he traveled to Africa four times to promote the church in West and South Africa. He also sent AME missionaries to Cuba and Mexico. Although he never completely relinquished his emigrationist ideas and remained in touch with numerous African leaders, Turner increasingly devoted the remainder of his life to church work. He died on May 8, 1915 in Windsor, Ontario, Canada while traveling on AME Church business.",

Taught to read by the son of his owner, Turner studied Christianity which he interpreted as condemning slavery. Turner also began to believe that God had chosen him to free his people from slavery. He soon became known among fellow slaves as “The Prophet.” Turner was sold to slaveholder Joseph Travis in 1830. Less than a year after the sale, Turner received what he assumed was a sign from God when he witnessed the eclipse of the sun. After sharing this experience with a few close friends, they began to plan an insurrection. While still planning the uprising, Turner saw that the color of the sun had changed to a bluish-green, which he believed was the final sign to initiate the uprising. With this confidence, Turner and seven other slaves moved forward with their plans. They first murdered the entire Travis family and eventually fifty whites in the futile effort to incite a general slave uprising. Only 75 slaves and free blacks joined the rebellion. They were soon pursued by over 3,000 members of the state militia. Turner and his followers were confronted by militiamen. One was killed and the others were captured. The rebellion was over in 48 hours. Turner escaped and eluded Virginia authorities for two months but was finally captured and tried for insurrection and murder. He was executed six days after his trial on November 5, 1831. In retaliation for the abortive rebellion, nearly two hundred innocent slaves were killed. Although Nat Turner did not end slavery as he may have hoped, he nonetheless shook the institution to its core. Pro-slavery advocates began calling for greater restrictions on free blacks and slaves in the South and made more demands on Northern whites to cease their interference with the servile institution. Northern abolitionists, however, viewed the uprising differently and intensified their efforts to end slavery throughout the nation.",

His father was an enslaved African who died a few months before his son’s birth, and his mother was a free woman of African ancestry. Walker grew up to despise the system of slavery that the U.S. government allowed in America. He knew the cruelties of slavery were not for him and said, “As true as God reigns, I will be avenged for the sorrow which my people have suffered.” He eventually moved to Boston during the 1820s and became very active within the free black community. Walker’s intense hatred for slavery culminated in him publishing his Appeal to the Colored Citizens of the World in September 1829. The Appeal was smuggled into the southern states, and was considered subversive, seditious, and incendiary by most white men in both northern and southern states. It was, without a doubt, one of the most controversial documents published in the antebellum period. Walker was concerned about many social issues affecting free and enslaved Africans in America during the time. He also expressed many beliefs that would become commonly promoted by later black nationalists such as: unified struggle for resistance of oppression (slavery), land reparations, self-government for people of African descent in America, racial pride, and a critique of American capitalism. His radical views prompted southern planters to offer a $3000 bounty for anyone who killed Walker and $10,000 reward for anyone who returned him alive back to the South. Walker was found dead in the doorway of his Boston home in 1830. Some people believed he was poisoned and others believed that he died of tuberculosis.",

        "summary": "Madam C.J. Walker invented a line of African American hair products after suffering from a scalp ailment that resulted in her own hair loss. She promoted her products by traveling around the country giving lecture-demonstrations and eventually established Madame C.J. Walker Laboratories to manufacture cosmetics and train sales beauticians. Her business acumen led her to be one of the first American women to become a self-made millionaire. She was also known for her philanthropic endeavors, including a donation toward the construction of an Indianapolis YMCA in 1913. Walker's life was portrayed in the 2020 TV show Self Made, with Octavia Spencer portraying Walker. Walker was born Sarah Breedlove on December 23, 1867, on a cotton plantation near Delta, Louisiana. Her parents, Owen and Minerva, were enslaved and recently freed, and Sarah, who was their fifth child, was the first in her family to be free-born. Minerva died in 1874 and Owen passed away the following year, both due to unknown causes, leaving Sarah an orphan at the age of seven. After her parents' passing, Sarah was sent to live with her sister, Louvinia, and her brother-in-law. The three moved to Vicksburg, Mississippi, in 1877, where Sarah picked cotton and was likely employed doing household work, although no documentation exists verifying her employment at the time. At age 14, to escape both her oppressive working environment and the frequent mistreatment she endured at the hands of her brother-in-law, Sarah married a man named Moses McWilliams. On June 6, 1885, Sarah gave birth to a daughter, A'Lelia. When Moses died two years later, Sarah and A'Lelia moved to St. Louis, where Sarah's brothers had established themselves as barbers. There, Sarah found work as a washerwoman, earning $1.50 a day — enough to send her daughter to the city's public schools. She also attended public night school whenever she could. While in St. Louis, Breedlove met husband Charles J. Walker, who worked in advertising and would later help promote her hair care business. During the 1890s, Sarah developed a scalp disorder that caused her to lose much of her hair, and she began to experiment with both home remedies and store-bought hair care treatments in an attempt to improve her condition. In 1905, she was hired as a commission agent by Annie Turnbo Malone — a successful, Black, hair-care product entrepreneur — and she moved to Denver, Colorado. While there, Sarah's husband, Charles, helped her create advertisements for a hair care treatment for African Americans that she was perfecting. Her husband also encouraged her to use the more recognizable name 'Madam C.J. Walker,' by which she was thereafter known. In 1907 Walker and her husband traveled around the South and Southeast promoting her products and giving lecture demonstrations of her 'Walker Method' — involving her own formula for pomade, brushing and the use of heated combs. As profits continued to grow, in 1908 Walker opened a factory and a beauty school in Pittsburgh, and by 1910, when Walker transferred her business operations to Indianapolis, the Madam C.J. Walker Manufacturing Company had become wildly successful, with profits that were the modern-day equivalent of several million dollars. In Indianapolis, the company not only manufactured cosmetics but also trained sales beauticians. These 'Walker Agents' became well known throughout the Black communities of the United States. In turn, they promoted Walker's philosophy of 'cleanliness and loveliness' as a means of advancing the status of African Americans. In 1913, Walker and Charles divorced, and she traveled throughout Latin America and the Caribbean promoting her business and recruiting others to teach her hair care methods. While her mother traveled, A'Lelia helped facilitate the purchase of property in Harlem, New York, recognizing that the area would be an important base for future business operations. In 1916, upon returning from her travels, Walker moved to her new townhouse in Harlem. From there, she would continue to operate her business, while leaving the day-to-day operations of her factory in Indianapolis to its forelady. Walker quickly immersed herself in the social and political culture of the Harlem Renaissance. She founded philanthropies that included educational scholarships and donations to homes for the elderly, the NAACP, and the National Conference on Lynching, among other organizations focused on improving the lives of African Americans. She also donated the largest amount of money by an African American toward the construction of an Indianapolis YMCA in 1913. In 1918, at Irvington-on-Hudson — about 20 miles north of New York City in the Hudson Valley — Walker built an Italianate mansion she called Villa Lewaro. It was designed by Vertner Tandy, an accomplished African American architect. Villa Lewaro was a gathering place for many luminaries of the Harlem Renaissance, and was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1976. Walker died of hypertension on May 25, 1919, at age 51, at Villa Lewaro. In 1981, the Madam C. J. Walker Manufacturing Company ceased operations. A line of cosmetics and hair-care products bearing the name Madam C.J. Walker Beauty Culture is available at Sephora retailers. Walker left one-third of her estate to her daughter, who would also become well-known as an important part of the Harlem Renaissance, and the remainder to various charities. Walker's funeral took place at Villa Lewaro, and she was buried at Woodlawn Cemetery in the Bronx, New York. In 1927, the Walker Building, an arts center that Walker had begun work on before her death, was opened in Indianapolis. An important African American cultural center for decades, it is now a registered National Historic Landmark. In 1998, the United States Postal Service issued a stamp of Walker as part of its 'Black Heritage' series.",

        "summary": "Booker T. Washington is one of the most controversial and dominant figures in African American history. According to his autobiography Up From Slavery (1901), he did not know the exact year, date, and place of his birth or his father’s name. Yet, it is widely understood that he was born enslaved on April 5, 1856 in Hale’s Ford, Virginia. His mother’s name was Jane and his father was a white man from a nearby plantation. At the age of nine, Washington was freed from slavery and moved to West Virginia. He had always been known as simply “Booker” until he decided to add the name “Washington” after feeling the pressure to have two names when he started grammar school. At the age of 16, Washington began college at the Hampton Normal and Agriculture Institute in Hampton, Virginia. He also attended Wayland Seminary from 1878 to 1879 before returning to teach at Hampton. As a result of a recommendation from Hampton officials, he became the first principal of Tuskegee Normal and Industrial Institute (now Tuskegee University), which opened on July 4, 1881; he remained in this capacity for 34 years until his death in 1915. Booker T. Washington with members of the Negro Business League in Greensboro, North Carolina, 1910 As the principal of Tuskegee Institute, Washington had the vehicle and platform to practice and espouse his educational philosophy and theory concerning the advancement of African Americans. In 1895 he was invited to speak at the opening of the Cotton States Exposition in Atlanta, Georgia where he advocated that African Americans could attain their constitutional rights through their own economic and moral progression by becoming efficient at practical skills such as farming, carpentry, and masonry rather than pursuing legal and political means for collective advancement. Moreover, he advanced the idea that African Americans should “compromise” and acquiesce to segregation, a position which garnered him the title of “The Great Accommodator.” Although Washington never publicly condemned forced segregation, Jim Crow laws, or lynching, he secretly contributed funds to the legal fight against them. This apparent paradox, among other actions, prompts the ongoing dialogue concerning the use and complexity of his tactics as scholars and other observers continue to wonder: who is the real Booker T. Washington? Washington’s contributions to African American advancement, such as his programs for rural extension work and his help in the development of the National Negro Business League, are numerous and so too are his accolades. He was the first African American to be featured on a United States postal stamp in 1940, and on a coin–the Booker T. Washington Memorial Half Dollar–minted from 1946 to 1951. He received an honorary Master of Arts degree from Harvard University in 1896 and an honorary doctorate degree from Dartmouth College in 1901. At Tuskegee University there is a monument in his honor called “Lifting the Veil” and it reads as follows: “He lifted the veil of ignorance from his people and pointed the way to progress through education and industry.” Booker T. Washington died at his home on the Tuskegee Institute campus on November 14, 1915. He was 59 at the time of his death.",

        "summary": "Activist and writer Ida B. Wells-Barnett first became prominent in the 1890s because she brought international attention to the lynching of African Americans in the South. Wells was born a slave in Holly Springs, Mississippi, in 1862. At the age of sixteen, she became primary caregiver to her six brothers and sisters, when both of her parents succumbed to yellow fever. After completing her studies at Rust College, where her father had sat on the board of trustees before his death, Wells divided her time between caring for her siblings and teaching school. She moved to Memphis, Tennessee in the 1880s. Wells first began protesting the treatment of black Southerners on a train ride between Memphis and her job at a rural school; the conductor told her that she must move to the train’s smoking car. Wells refused, arguing that she had purchased a first-class ticket. The conductor and other passengers then physically removed her from the train. Wells returned to Memphis, hired a lawyer, and sued the Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad Company. The court decided in her favor, awarding Wells $500. The railroad company appealed, and in 1887, the Supreme Court of Tennessee reversed the previous decision and ordered Wells to pay court fees. Using the pseudonym “Iola,” Wells began to write editorials in black newspapers that challenged Jim Crow laws in the South. She bought a share of a Memphis newspaper, the Free Speech and Headlight, and used it to further the cause of African American civil rights. After the lynching of three of her friends in 1892, Wells became one of the nation’s most vocal anti-lynching activists. Calvin McDowell, Thomas Moss, and Henry Stewart owned the People’s Grocery in Memphis, but their economic success angered the white owners of a store across the street. On March 9, a group of white men gathered to confront McDowell, Moss, and Stewart. During the ensuing scuffle, several of the white men received injuries, and authorities arrested the three black business owners. A white mob subsequently broke into the jail, captured McDowell, Moss, and Stewart, and lynched them. Incensed by the murder of her friends, Wells launched an extensive investigation of lynching. In 1892, she published a pamphlet, “Southern Horrors,” which detailed her findings. Through her lectures and books such as A Red Record (1895), Wells countered the “rape myth” used by lynch mobs to justify the murder of African Americans. Through her research she found that lynch victims had challenged white authority or had successfully competed with whites in business or politics. As a result of her outspokenness, a mob destroyed the offices of the Free Speech and threatened to kill Wells. She fled Memphis determined to continue her campaign to raise awareness of southern lynching. Wells took her movement to England, and established the British Anti-Lynching Society in 1894. She returned to the U.S. and settled in Chicago, Illinois, where she married attorney and newspaper editor Ferdinand L. Barnett in 1895. Wells-Barnett also worked to advance other political causes. She protested the exclusion of African Americans from the 1893 World’s Columbian Exposition in Chicago, and three years later, she helped launch the National Association of Colored Women (NACW). In 1909, Wells was a founding member of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). She also actively campaigned for women’s suffrage. Ida Wells-Barnett died in Chicago in 1931 at the age of 69.",

Susannah Wheatley taught Phillis to read not only English but some Latin. While yet in her teens, Phillis Wheatley became the first African American woman to publish a book of poetry, and the third woman in the American colonies to do so. That book, Poems on Various Subjects, Religious and Moral, became controversial twice. Wheatley was alive to defend herself during the first controversy in 1772, when she was summoned before an august group of white Bostonians to prove that she had actually composed her poetry, since common thought of the day denied the possibility of intellectual or aesthetic gifts in Africans. The second time Wheatley and her poetry became controversial was during the 1960s, when her blithe and sometimes glorified treatment of slavery was identified as a hindrance to historical truth and to the Civil Rights Movement. One poem in particular brought Wheatley into a shadowy view: “On Being Brought from Africa to America.” In the poem, she speaks of the “pagan land” of her birth and her “benighted soul” which was saved when was enslaved. Echoing common folklore of the day which held that Africans were the seed of Cain, Wheatley’s poem says, “Remember, Christians, Negroes black as Cain / May be refin’d, and join th’ angelic train.” Although she remains a controversial figure among African American writers, the significance of her place in American history is uncontested. Phillis Wheatley met or received correspondence from the most famous leaders of the American Revolution, including John Paul Jones, George Washington, Benjamin Franklin, and John Hancock. (Thomas Jefferson was aware but dismissive of Wheatley’s work.) She remains the matriarch of African American literature, and was certainly the most famous African American woman of her day. Wheatley was emancipated after the publication of her first book of poetry. She married John Peters, a free black grocer who ultimately abandoned her. They had three children, but all three died in infancy, the last just a few hours after Wheatley’s own death at age 31. Wheatley had completed and tried to publish a second book of poetry by the time she died, but failed to find enough subscribers. Although her work would later be resurrected by abolitionists of the Nineteenth Century, Phillis Wheatley died in a poor dwelling, having fallen from the heights of fame as a poet to the depths of poverty, employed as a seamstress and a common servant.",

        "summary": "Walter Francis White was a leading civil rights advocate of the first half of the twentieth century. As executive secretary of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) from 1931 to 1955, he was one of the major architects of the modern African American freedom struggle. White, whose blond hair and blue eyes belied his African American ancestry, was born in Atlanta, Georgia on July 1, 1893, the fourth of seven children. His parents, George W. White, a graduate of Atlanta University and a postal worker, and Madeline Harrison White, a Clark University graduate and school teacher, were solidly middle class at the time when the vast majority of Atlanta blacks were working class. Walter White graduated from Atlanta University in 1916 and one year later helped establish the Atlanta branch of the NAACP after briefly working as an insurance agent. In 1918, at the invitation of James Weldon Johnson, the NAACP’s executive director, White moved to New York City, New York, and became the assistant secretary for the national organization. White’s first major racial justice campaign effort in the national NAACP office came when he persuaded the Association to oppose the Atlanta Board of Education’s decision to eliminate seventh grade for African American students as part of an effort to finance a new high school for white students. Between 1918 and 1931, White built a national reputation both within and beyond NAACP circles. He authored a number of books, including Rope and Faggot: A Biography of Judge Lynch (1929), which became a major expose of lynching in the U.S. At great personal risk, White used his fair skin, blue eyes, and other “white” features, to successfully infiltrate the Ku Klux Klan and other white supremacist organizations. His clandestine surveys of these groups and their activities gave the NAACP first-hand knowledge of at least 40 murders of black people. By 1931 White had become executive secretary, the highest position in the association. During his tenure, the NAACP led the fight for anti-lynching legislation, and initiated trailblazing legal battles to eliminate all-white primaries, poll taxes and de jure segregation. Working with labor leader A. Philip Randolph, White in 1941 helped persuade President Franklin D. Roosevelt to issue Executive Order 8802 which prohibited racial discrimination in defense industries and established the Fair Employment Practices Commission (FEPC), the first Federal agency to monitor compliance with anti-discrimination measures. Although White devoted most of his attention to African American issues, he also participated in anti-racism efforts around the world. He was a delegate to the Second Pan-African Congress in 1921, a member of the Advisory Council for the Government of the Virgin Islands in 1934-35, and an advisor to the United States delegation to the founding conference of the United Nations in 1945 and the 1948 General Assembly in Paris, France. White’s 1945 book A Rising Wind helped inspired President Harry Truman to desegregate the US military in 1948. Truman also appointed the first presidential committee on civil rights later that year at the urging of White. The group’s statement in 1948 emerged as the basis of the Democratic Party’s platform plank on civil rights in 1948, and according to many historians, established the commitment of that national party to racial equality. Walter White, who was a member of Sigma Pi Phi fraternity, served as the NAACP’s executive secretary until his death on March 21, 1955. White was 65. He was succeeded as executive director by Roy Wilkins.",

        "summary": "Roy Wilkins, one of the leading US civil rights activists of the twentieth century, was born in St. Louis, Missouri. Wilkins’ mother died of tuberculosis when he was four; he and his siblings were then raised by an aunt and uncle in a poor but racially integrated neighborhood in St. Paul, Minnesota. Wilkins enrolled in the University of Minnesota in 1919 and—despite working full-time—graduated with a degree in sociology in 1923. He then became editor of the small African American newspaper the St. Paul Appeal. By the late 1920s, Wilkins became managing editor of the Kansas City Call, one of the larger Midwest black newspapers. In 1929 he married social worker Aminda ‘Minnie’ Badeau; the couple had no children. Although a journalist during the 1920s, Wilkins was hired in 1934 by Walter White as the assistant secretary of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). He served in that post until 1934 when he was named editor of the NAACP’s official journal Crisis, succeeding W.E.B. DuBois, who abruptly resigned from the Association because of a policy dispute. From 1949 to 1950 Wilkins led the National Emergency Civil Rights Mobilization, a coalition of more than 100 local and national groups. In 1950, A. Philip Randolph of the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters and Arnold Aronson of the National Jewish Community Relations Advisory Council founded the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights (LCCR), which served for the next two decades as the major Washington D.C. lobby for civil rights legislation. In 1955, Wilkins became executive secretary of the Association following the death of Walter F. White, and in 1964 became its executive director. As leader of the oldest and largest civil rights organization in the nation, Wilkins soon became a key figure in the national protests that became known as the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s. As a popular and eloquent voice for that movement, Wilkins directed the NAACP’s fight against de jure and de facto segregation and racial inequality. He played a key role in organizing the 1963 March on Washington which led to the 1964 Civil Rights Act and the Selma to Montgomery March in Alabama which produced the 1965 Voting Rights Act. He also participated in the 1966 March Against Fear in Mississippi following the attempted assassination of James Meredith. Throughout this period Wilkins was a staunch advocate of legislative reform and nonviolence and consulted with Presidents Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon, Ford and Carter on civil rights issues. In 1967, he was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Lyndon Johnson. Wilkins fiercely opposed the post-1966 militancy of the Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee and more generally the Black Power Movement. Although Wilkins and Dr. Martin Luther King were often allies during the civil rights era, they were sharply divided over King’s criticism of the Vietnam War. In 1977 Wilkins retired as executive Director of the NAACP and was succeeded by Dr. Benjamin Hooks. Later that year he was honored by the Association with the title of Director Emeritus. Roy Wilkins, a member of Sigma Pi Phi Fraternity, died on September 8, 1981 in New York City. He was 80.",

        "summary": "Daniel Hale Williams III was a pioneering surgeon best known for performing in 1893 one of the world’s first successful open heart surgeries. Williams was born on January 18, 1856, in Hollidaysburg, Pennsylvania to Sarah Price Williams and Daniel Hale Williams II. Following the death of his father, Williams lived with family friends in Baltimore, Maryland, and with family in Illinois, from 1866 to 1878 where he was a shoemaker’s apprentice and barber until he decided to pursue his education. In 1878, Williams’s interest in medicine began when he worked in the office of Henry Palmer, a Wisconsin surgeon. In 1880 he enrolled in the Chicago Medical College, receiving a Doctor of Medicine degree three years later. Immediately after graduation Williams opened his own practice in Chicago and taught anatomy at Chicago Medical College. He became a trailblazer, setting high standards in medical procedures and sanitary conditions, including adopting recently-discovered sterilization procedures in regard to germ transmission and prevention. He also avoided the then-common practice of black doctors being barred from staff privileges in white hospitals by starting his own hospital. In 1891 Williams co-founded Provident Hospital and Training School Association in a three-story building on Chicago’s South Side. At a time when only 909 black physicians served 7.5 million African Americans, Provident was the first black-controlled hospital in the nation. Yet Provident was also the first medical facility to have an interracial staff and the first training facility for African American nurses in the US. During Williams’s tenure as physician-owner (1891-1912), Provident hospital grew, largely due to its extremely high success rate in patient recovery: 87 percent. In 1893, Williams daringly performed open heart surgery on a young black man, James Cornish, who had received severe stab wounds in his chest. Despite having a limited array of surgical equipment and medicine, Williams opened Cornish’s chest cavity and operated on his heart without the patient dying from infection. Cornish recovered within 51 days and went on to live for 50 more years. Now nationally recognized, Williams in 1894 was appointed Chief Surgeon at Freedmen’s Hospital in Washington, D.C. As Chief Surgeon, Williams set high standards for doctors from all over the world, who came to witness his operations. He also reorganized Freedmen’s Hospital which had suffered years of neglect, instituting a training school for black nurses, employing a multiracial staff, improving surgical procedures, developing ambulance services, and providing staff opportunities for numerous black physicians. Although he recognized the value of racial integration in the medical field, Williams in 1895 co-founded the National Medical Association (NMA) because black medical practitioners were denied admission to the all-white American Medical Association. In 1898, Williams left the Freedmen’s Hospital, married Alice Johnson, and moved with her to Chicago where he returned to Provident Hospital. Among the numerous honors and awards bestowed on Williams, perhaps the most groundbreaking was his becoming in 1913 the first black member of the exclusive American College of Surgeons. Later he joined Sigma Pi Phi fraternity, the first Greek-letter organization for African Americans. A year after settling in Chicago, Williams became affiliated with Meharry Medical College in Nashville, Tennessee. For the next two decades he was a visiting clinical surgeon. He was also now invited to work at larger hospitals including Cook County Hospital, and at St. Luke’s Hospital on Chicago’s South Side from 1907 to 1926. In 1926, Williams retired from St. Luke’s after surviving a debilitating stroke. He lived out his retirement years in Idlewild, Michigan, an all-black resort community, until his death on August 4, 1931. He was 75 at the time of his death.",

By the time he was five, his parents divorced. His mother remarried in the late 1950s and the family moved to the predominately white working class Hazelwood District. The only black student at his Catholic high school, Wilson transferred schools and ultimately dropped out of school at age 15 when he was accused of plagiarism. Wilson earned his high school diploma from the Carnegie Library. After a short stint in the Army, Wilson began writing poetry while working various low paying jobs. Although already a published poet, it wasn’t until 1965, while listening to a Bessie Smith record, when Wilson was inspired to write about African American history and culture through plays. That same year, he formally changed his name to August Wilson to honor his mother. August Wilson wrote Jitney!, the first in his cycle of ten plays and it proved to be a success. It went on to be produced by the Allegheny Repertory Theatre in Pittsburgh. His play, Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom, was accepted for workshop production at the Eugene O’Neill Theatre Center in 1982. After 275 shows and several awards, the show finally closed in 1985. Wilson’s career skyrocketed with his play Fences, written in 1983, which generated his first Pulitzer Prize. As Fences was still in production on Broadway, Wilson’s next play, Joe Turner’s Come and Gone, was released making Wilson the first African American to have two simultaneous plays on Broadway. In 1986, August Wilson wrote The Piano Lesson, which won a Tony Award for Best Play, the New York Drama Critics’ Circle Award, and the Pulitzer Prize for Drama. Wilson became one of only seven American playwrights to be awarded two Pulitzer Prizes. Wilson’s next two plays, Two Trains Running and Seven Guitars received several awards.

Forbes magazine included her in its 2003 list of America’s billionaires, the first African American woman to become one. The Oprah Winfrey Show ran for 25 seasons and was syndicated to 214 television stations in the U.S. and to 139 countries. Launched in April 2000, O, The Oprah Magazine, has a current circulation of 2.4 million monthly readers, and was considered one of the most successful magazine launches in publishing history. In 2004, a companion publication, O at Home, made its debut. Ms. Winfrey has garnered numerous honors and awards in recognition of her many contributions and achievements. After receiving more than forty Emmy awards, she removed herself from further consideration. In 1998, she received a Lifetime Achievement Award from the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences. She has been honored by the National Book Foundation. In 2005, Winfrey was inducted into the Hall of Fame of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), and two years later, she was awarded the 2007 Humanitarian Award from the Elie Wiesel Foundation for Humanity. Born Oprah Gail Winfrey on January 29, 1954, in Kosciusko, Mississippi, she was first raised by her impoverished grandmother on a farm. At age six, she went to live with her mother Vernita in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. There she was sexually abused by male relatives and friends of her mother. In 1993, Winfrey testified before a Senate Judiciary Committee in favor of a National Child Protection Act, which President Bill Clinton signed into law as the “Oprah Bill” in of that year. At age 13, Winfrey went to live with her father Vernon in Nashville, Tennessee. Under his strict supervision, she was required to read a book a week, contributing to her lifelong love of books and reading. In 1971, Winfrey entered Tennessee State University, and began working in radio and television in Nashville. She was the first African American woman to anchor the news at Nashville’s WTVF. In 1976, she moved to Baltimore, Maryland, where she co-anchored the evening news and in 1978 became co-host of the talk show People Are Talking. In 1984, she was recruited to host her own Chicago, Illinois show AM Chicago. Competing in the time slot with the well-known talk show host Phil Donahue, months her show had more viewers and went from last to first in the ratings within months. AM Chicago was renamed The Oprah Winfrey Show and went on to become one of the most successful shows in television history. In 1988, Winfrey founded Chicago-based Harpo Productions, becoming only the third woman in American entertainment to own her own production facility; Harpo’s acquisition the same year of the Oprah Winfrey Show made her the first woman to own and produce her own talk show. The show’s exposure led to her being offered the role of Sofia in Steven Spielberg’s film adaptation of Alice Walker’s Pulitzer Prize winning novel, The Color Purple, in 1985. Winfrey was nominated for a Best Supporting Actress Academy Award for the role. The cast also included Danny Glover and Whoopi Goldberg. Through Harpo’s film division, Winfrey produced the 1989 television miniseries The Women of Brewster Place. In 1998, Winfrey produced the movie Beloved, adapted from Toni Morrison’s Pulitzer and Nobel Prize winning novel. Winfrey played the role of Sethe, the leading character in the novel. In 2005 Harpo’s made-for-TV movie, Their Eyes Were Watching God, which was adapted from the novel by Zora Neale Hurston, won both Emmy and Golden Globe awards for actress Halle Berry. Winfrey’s debut as a Broadway producer came with the opening of the musical The Color Purple in 2005. In 2007, she co-produced the Golden Globe nominated film The Great Debaters, starring Denzel Washington and Forest Whitaker. Oprah’s Book Club, featured on her online website, www.Oprah.com, and intermittently on her TV show, is the largest book club in the world. Relatively unknown works chosen as book club selections have been propelled to the top of best seller lists. The Oprah website averages over 6.7 million visitors per month. In 2006, Winfrey launched Oprah and Friends, a satellite radio channel. Winfrey’s philanthropic contributions include Oprah’s Angel Network and the Oprah Winfrey Foundation. In 2005, Business Week named her the greatest black philanthropist in American history. During a 2000 visit to meet Nelson Mandela, Winfrey pledged to open a school in South Africa. The Oprah Winfrey Leadership Academy for Girls opened in January 2007 in Henley-on-Klip, South Africa. Winfrey has also recognized the service of others. At her Legends Ball in 2006 she honored the accomplishments of African American women such as author Maya Angelou, civil rights activist Coretta Scott King, and actress Ruby Dee, as well as “young uns” Halle Berry and Michelle Obama.

        "summary": "Historian Carter G. Woodson was born to poor, yet land-owning, former slaves in New Canton, Virginia on December 19, 1875. During the 1890s, he hired himself out as a farm and manual laborer, drove a garbage truck, worked in coalmines, and attended high school and college in Berea College, Kentucky—from which he earned a B.L. degree in 1903. In the early 1900s, he taught black youth in West Virginia. From late 1903 until early 1907, Woodson worked in the Philippines under the auspices of the US War Department. Woodson then traveled to Africa, Asia, and Europe and briefly attended the Sorbonne in Paris, France. In 1908, he received an M.A. degree in History, Romance languages, and Literature from the University of Chicago in Illinois. In 1912, while teaching in Washington, D.C., he earned his doctorate in history from Harvard University. In 1915, Woodson published his first book, The Education of the Negro Prior to 1861 and co-founded the Association for the Study of Negro Life and History (ASNLH). In 1916, he singlehandedly launched The Journal of Negro History, now The Journal of African American History. In 1918, Woodson published A Century of Negro Migration and became the principal of Armstrong Manual Training School, Washington, D.C. From 1919 until 1920, he was the Dean of Howard University’s School of Liberal Arts and from 1920 until 1922 he served as a dean at West Virginia Collegiate Institute. In 1921, he published The History of the Negro Church and founded the Associated Publishers, Inc. After founding the ASNLH, he also became active in black organizations like the NAACP, the National Urban League, the Friends of Negro Freedom, and the Committee of 200. In 1922, he published the first edition of his popular The Negro in Our History and decided to commit his life’s work, routinely laboring 18 hours per day, to the ASNLH and the early black history movement. On July 18, 1922, he purchased a three-story, late-nineteenth century Italianate style row house in Washington D.C. located at 1538 Ninth Street, NW that became his personal residence as well as the office for the Associated Publishers, Inc. and the national headquarters of the ASNLH. During the 1920s, Woodson received tens of thousands dollars from several white philanthropists to fund the ASNLH’s various activities. In 1926, he launched Negro History Week. By the early 1930s, Woodson relied upon black communities throughout the country to maintain his organization’s activities. In 1937, he created The Negro History Bulletin mainly for children and schoolteachers and throughout the 1930s and 1940s Woodson spoke at countless elementary and high schools, Negro History Week events, and at the graduation ceremonies for many HBCUs. Once in Detroit, Michigan in February 1935, he addressed “more than three thousand persons.” During the 1930s and 1940s, Woodson wrote several hundred essays in leading black newspapers such as the New York Age, the Pittsburgh Courier from Pennsylvania, the Afro-American from Baltimore, Maryland, and the Chicago Defender. In 1933, he published The Mis-Education of the Negro. Though he wrote, co-authored, and/or edited more than twenty books, this is his most famous and enduring book. Woodson, a member of Sigma Pi Phi fraternity,, died suddenly from a heart attack in his “office home” on April 3, 1950. Woodson was 74 at the time of his death. He never married and had no children. Deservingly dubbed “The Father of Black History,” he was, simply put, a black history institution builder.",

        "occupation": "Author",
        "summary": "Best-selling author, social critic and influential literary figure Richard Wright was born on September 4, 1908, to Nathan Wright and Ella Wilson, both children of slaves, on a plantation near Roxie, Mississippi. His father was an illiterate sharecropper and his mother was a schoolteacher. Finding farm life unprofitable, the family moved to Memphis, Tennessee, where Wright encountered violence, racism and eventual poverty when his father abandoned the family. After his mother fell ill in 1915, Wright and his brother were sent to an orphanage, then back to Mississippi to live with their grandparents. Wright felt isolated as a non-religious member of the strict Seventh Day Adventist household. He published his first short story, “The Voodoo of Hell’s Half-Acre,” in 1924 in The Southern Register and held a series of jobs before moving to Chicago in 1927. As part of the new black urban intelligentsia evolving in northern cities like Chicago and New York, Wright became a critic of the black urban experience and in 1932 joined the Communist Party. He was influenced by University of Chicago sociologists Robert Park and Horace Cayton, Jr., who portrayed black urban spaces as ghettoes mired in poverty. Like most migrants to the north, the life Wright experienced did not live up to his expectations. He began to see conflicts within the Communist philosophy, and eventually abandoned his affiliation. In 1937, he moved to New York City, where he won federal funding as a writer through the Works Progress Administration. Three years later, he published his most popular novel, Native Son (1940). Native Son became an instant best seller with more than 250,000 copies sold within three weeks of its release. It was the first book by a black writer to be endorsed by the Book-of-the-Month Club, reaching an even wider audience. Native Son remains one of the most influential novels of the 20th Century. In Native Son Wright uses the story of Bigger Thomas, a 20-year-old black migrant, to illustrate the poverty, hopelessness and alienation of the black residents in Chicago’s South Side. His was the first of the genre of “ghetto realism” novels that remain popular today. In addition to his early alignment with Communism, Wright went through several philosophical phases in his literary career, like his existential novel The Outsider (1953), and his anti-colonialist essays in White Man, Listen! (1957). Despite his major and often abrupt political and sociological shifts, he consistently promoted black culture and black protest that he saw emerging in urban life. His writings, including his acclaimed autobiographical Black Boy (1945), in many ways presaged the Black Power movement of the 1960s and 1970s. In 1941, Wright married Ellen Poplar after an earlier failed marriage, and they had two daughters. He moved his family to Paris in 1946, stating his reasons in a poem titled “I Choose Exile” (1950). In Paris, it seemed to Wright that for the first time in his life he could be both a writer and a black man. Richard Wright was one of the first African American writers to achieve literary fame and fortune in the U.S. He died in Paris on November 28, 1960 as one of the most influential African-American writers of the 20th century.",

        "fun_fact": "Richard Wright's novel Native Son (1940) became a bestseller nearly as soon as it was published by Harper & Brothers, just before the United States entered into World War II. With the release of Native Son, Wright also became the wealthiest African American writer in the country."

        "occupation": "Minister, Activist",
        "summary": "Malcolm X, one of the most influential African American leaders of the 20th Century, was born Malcolm Little in Omaha, Nebraska on May 19, 1925 to Earl Little, a Georgia native and itinerant Baptist preacher, and Louise Norton Little who was born in the West Indian island of Grenada. Shortly after Malcolm was born the family moved to Lansing, Michigan. Earl Little joined Marcus Garvey’s Universal Negro Improvement Association (UNIA) where he publicly advocated black nationalist beliefs, prompting the local white supremacist Black Legion to set fire to their home. Little was killed by a streetcar in 1931. Authorities ruled it a suicide but the family believed he was killed by white supremacists. Although an academically gifted student, Malcolm dropped out of high school after a teacher ridiculed his aspirations to become a lawyer. He then moved to the Roxbury district of Boston, Massachusetts to live with an older half-sister, Ella Little Collins. Malcolm worked odd jobs in Boston and then moved to Harlem in 1943 where he drifted into a life of drug dealing, pimping, gambling and other forms of “hustling.” He avoided the draft in World War II by declaring his intent to organize black soldiers to attack whites which led to his classification as “mentally disqualified for military service.” Malcolm was arrested for burglary in Boston in 1946 and received a ten year prison sentence. There he joined the Nation of Islam (NOI). Upon his parole in 1952, Malcolm was called to Chicago, Illinois by NOI leader, the Honorable Elijah Muhammad. Like other converts, he changed his surname to “X,” symbolizing, he said, the rejection of “slave names” and his inability to claim his ancestral African name. Recognizing his promise as a speaker and organizer for the Nation of Islam, Muhammad sent Malcolm to Boston to become the Minister of Temple Number Eleven. His proselytizing success earned a reassignment in 1954 to Temple Number Seven in Harlem. Although New York’s one million blacks comprised the largest African American urban population in the United States, Malcolm noted that “there weren’t enough Muslims to fill a city bus. “Fishing” in Christian storefront churches and at competing black nationalist meetings, Malcolm built up the membership of Temple Seven. He also met his future wife, Sister Betty X, a nursing student who joined the temple in 1956. They married and eventually had six daughters. Malcolm X quickly became a national public figure in July 1959 when CBS aired Mike Wallace’s expose on the NOI, “The Hate That Hate Produced.” This documentary revealed the views of the NOI, of which Malcolm was the principal spokesperson and showed those views to be in sharp contrast to those of most well-known African American leaders of the time. Soon, however, Malcolm was increasingly frustrated by the NOI’s bureaucratic structure and refusal to participate in the Civil Rights Movement. His November 1963 speech in Detroit, “Message to the Grass Roots,” a bold attack on racism and a call for black unity, foreshadowed the split with his spiritual mentor, Elijah Muhammad. However, Malcolm on December 1, in response to a reporter’s question about the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, used the phrase “chickens coming home to roost” which to Muslims meant that Allah was punishing white America for crimes against black people. Whatever the personal views of Muslims about Kennedy’s death, Elijah Muhammad had given strict orders to his ministers not to comment on the assassination. Malcolm defied the order and was suspended from the NOI for ninety days. Malcolm used the suspension to announce on March 8, 1964, his break with the NOI and his creation of the Muslim Mosque, Inc. Three months later he formed a strictly political group (an action expressly banned by the NOI), called the Organization of Afro American Unity (OAAU) which was roughly patterned after the Organization of African Unity (OAU). His dramatic political transformation was revealed when he spoke to the Militant Labor Forum of the Socialist Worker’s Party. Malcolm placed the Black Revolution in the context of a worldwide anti-imperialist struggle taking place in Africa, Asia, and Latin America, noting that “when I say black, I mean non-white—black, brown, red or yellow.” By April 1964, while speaking at a CORE rally in Cleveland, Ohio, Malcolm gave his famous “The Ballot or the Bullet” speech in which he described black Americans as “victims of democracy.” Malcolm traveled to Africa and the Middle East in late Spring 1964 and was received like a visiting head of state in many countries including Egypt, Nigeria, Tanzania, Kenya, and Ghana. While there, Malcolm made his hajj to Mecca, Saudi Arabia and added El-Hajj to his official NOI name Malik El-Shabazz. The tour forced Malcolm to realize that one’s political position as a revolutionary superseded “color.” The transformed Malcolm reiterated these views when he addressed an OAAU rally in New York, declaring for a pan-African struggle “by any means necessary.” Malcolm spent six months in Africa in 1964 in an unsuccessful attempt to get international support for a United Nations investigation of human rights violations of Afro Americans in the United States. In February 1965, Malcolm flew to Paris, France to continue his efforts but was denied entry amidst rumors that he was on a Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) hit list. Upon his return to New York, his home was firebombed. Events continued to spiral downward and on February 21, 1965, Malcolm X was assassinated at the Audubon Ballroom in the Washington Heights section of Manhattan.",
